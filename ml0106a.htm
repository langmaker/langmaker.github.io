      <H4 align=right><EM>Suzanne Vega</EM>, &quot;Language&quot;</H4>
      <P> If language <STRONG>were</STRONG> liquid, we could enter a submersible 
        and use sound waves to reveal the subterranean terrain. For each word 
        floats like a buoy, anchored to some unseen spot far below. The meanings 
        of the word <EM>brother</EM> seem easy to pick out from the waters, but 
        in fact the possible meanings stretch deeper than you might expect, ranging 
        from &quot;full brother&quot; to &quot;any kinsman&quot; to &quot;any 
        fellow human&quot; to &quot;anything related&quot; (as in <EM>the brother 
        vices of greed and selfishness</EM>). Since we can't use sonar, how can 
        we sound out the meanings of words? 
      <P> It used to be thought that any word could be described in terms of semantic 
        primitives. For instance, M. Bierwisch, writing in 1970, said that semantic 
        features do not differ from language to language, but are rather part 
        of the general human capacity for language, forming a universal inventory 
        used in particular ways in individual languages. 
      <P> According to this theory, every word can be broken up into primitive 
        kernels of meaning, called <EM>semantemes</EM> (also called <EM>semantic 
        features</EM> or <EM>semantic components</EM>). Some sample definitions 
        using semantemes:

      <P> The process of breaking words down into semantemes is known as <EM>componential 
        analysis</EM> and has been most often used to analyze kinship terms across 
        languages. The components are often given in more detail. For instance, 
        kinship terms like those shown above might have three components: sex, 
        generation, lineage. Sex would be male or female; generation would be 
        a number, with 0 = reference point's generation, -1 = previous generation, 
        +1 = next generation; lineage would be either direct, colineal (as in 
        siblings) or ablineal (as in uncles and aunts). 
      <P> This is obviously a highly technical way to define words we all know 
        and use without overdue consideration, but -- by using these components 
        -- you can concisely define a variety of English kinship terms.

      <P> This can be the starting point of a more detailed analysis of English 
        terms. One advantage of isolating and identifying each component is that 
        it then becomes possible to identify &quot;holes&quot; in a language's 
        vocabulary, areas for which it lacks a direct term. For instance, English 
        lacks a genderless word for an aunt or uncle; you can't fill in the blank 
        for the statement &quot;<EM>parent</EM> is to <EM>mother</EM> and <EM>father</EM>, 
        as <EM>***</EM> is to <EM>aunt</EM> and <EM>uncle</EM>&quot;. You can 
        still express this concept in English (we typically refer to <EM>aunts 
        and uncles</EM> but you can more formally refer to <EM>parents' siblings</EM>), 
        but you will likely express it less often than you would if there was 
        a word for it. 
      <P> Another gap is the lack of words for either &quot;male cousin&quot; 
        or &quot;female cousin&quot;. The paradigm <EM>parent/mother/father</EM>, 
        <EM>sibling/sister/brother</EM> is just not carried out for <EM>cousin</EM>. 
        This is unlike other Germanic languages, including Danish (<EM>Faetter</EM> 
        and <EM>Kusine</EM> for male and female cousins respectively), Dutch (<EM>neef</EM> 
        and <EM>nicht</EM>) and German (<EM>der Vetter</EM> and <EM>die Kusine</EM>). 
        Old English probably also made this distinction, but lost it under influence 
        of Norman French, which -- like most, if not all, Romance languages -- 
        does not make this distinction. 
      <P> The following table more fully fleshes out the distinctions English 
        does make in kinship terms.

      <P> There are many more &quot;holes&quot; or gaps in the vocabulary than 
        those labeled here. What about terms where the generation is not specified? 
        Where the lineage is not specified? 
      <P> Please note that the combination of {Generation 0, Lineage Direct} is 
        meaningless (except for some backwater place -- choose your own to make 
        fun of -- where brothers marry their sisters and people can be their own 
        fathers). Since the sense of {Lineage Colineal} only applies to a generation 
        of 0, it could be thought of as the manifestation of Direct in that area. 
        (The term Ablineal can apply to any generation.) 
      <P> A fuller componential analysis (yes, fuller) of kinship terms is presented 
        in a sidebar below. 
      <P> While componential analysis is useful for some exercises, it is not 
        a representation of how language works; no linguist has ever been able 
        to develop a complete list of semantic primitives. Invariably, some of 
        the primitives identified are actually molecules that can be broken down 
        into new atoms. For instance, <EM>parent</EM>, <EM>offspring</EM> and 
        <EM>sibling</EM> are all interrelated terms; the word <EM>parent</EM> 
        can be defined as &quot;a person who has offspring&quot; and <EM>sibling</EM> 
        can be defined as &quot;a person with a parent who has other offspring&quot;. 
        If semantic primitives were to exist, they would number in the thousands 
        and would resemble a mathematical logic system more than the mind's loom 
        of language. 
      <HR>
      <H2><A NAME="BM1a">The bother of <EM>brother</EM> </A></H2>
      <P> While Suzanne Vega sings of language being liquid, the rigidity of componential 
        analysis makes language seem like frozen liquid: ice cubes. While semantemes 
        have their place, especially to compare and contrast languages' lexicons, 
        they do not indicate how we actually define terms in our minds. 
      <P> One of the problems with semantemes is that they assume words have a 
        single basic meaning. Take <EM>brother</EM>, which was defined above first 
        as &quot;male sibling&quot; and then as {Generation 0, Sex Male, Lineage 
        Colineal}. The English word actually has a much broader meaning than either 
        of these definitions, with many degrees of <EM>brother</EM>-ness radiating 
        out from a core meaning of &quot;male sibling&quot;, as shown below in 
        a no-means exhaustive list.

                  </UL>
              </UL>
          </UL>
      </UL>
      <P> Defining these labels in more detail we have: 
      <OL>
        <LI>A male having the same biological parents as another person: a brother-german 
        <LI>A male having one biological parent in common with another person: 
          a half brother 
        <LI>The son of one's stepparent by a previous spouse or lover: a stepbrother 
        <LI>A male with the same ancestor as another person: a kinsman 
        <LI>A male friend who is loved as if he were a biological brother: a comrade 
        <LI>A male friend who belongs to the same fraternity: fellow fraternity 
          member 
        <LI>A man who follows the same religious beliefs: a co-religionist 
        <LI>A male lay member of a religious order: a monk or lay person 
        <LI>A person of the same race or nation 
        <LI>A fellow man 
        <LI>Something that closely resembles another in kind 
      </OL>
      <P> Even this radius of meaning is not exhaustive: a <EM>brother</EM> can 
        mean a &quot;brother-in-law&quot;, a <EM>brother</EM> can be an adopted 
        son raised by your parents, a <EM>brother</EM> can be used in the strict 
        sense of &quot;a fellow African American&quot;. The gender of a brother 
        does not even have to be male -- <EM>we must help our brothers in the 
        Fatherland</EM> uses <EM>brother</EM> to include both men and women (as 
        illustrated in meaning #9 above). 
      <P> As this example shows, people think of words not as fixed definitions 
        composed of semantic primitives, but as examples or prototypes. The prototypical 
        brother has the same biological parents as another person and has an emotionally 
        close relationship with his siblings. On a scale of <EM>brother</EM>-ness 
        from 0 to 100 the prototype is 100. A 90 might be a brother who was twenty 
        years older than another person and as a result was never close to him, 
        or the brother who was abusive and was disliked -- even though these examples 
        are biologically brothers, they do not share in that emotional closeness 
        of true <EM>brother</EM>-ness. A best friend can be considered a <EM>brother</EM> 
        on the basis of emotional closeness, rather than kinship. The brother 
        virtues of love and charity are considered brothers only because they 
        resemble one another -- this is a metaphorical use of the primary sense 
        of <EM>brother</EM>, scoring perhaps a 10 out of 100 on our hypothetical 
        scale of <EM>brother</EM>-ness. 
      <P> The word <EM>brother</EM>, then, is defined not in terms of semantic 
        primitives, but in terms of a network of associations with other words. 
        The human brain recursively defines words by words (just like a dictionary). 
      <HR>
      <H2><A NAME="BM1b">Translations (meanings across languages) </A> </H2>
      <P> When you decide to translate <EM>brother</EM> into your model language, 
        you will have to decide which of its many meanings you wish to convey. 
        Too often we assume that an English word has exact counterparts in other 
        languages. We say that English <EM>brother</EM> = Spanish <EM>hermano</EM>, 
        when in fact <EM>hermano</EM> has different connotations. For one thing, 
        <EM>hermano</EM> is the expression of a root form <EM>herman-</EM> with 
        a masculine ending; give it a feminine ending and you have <EM>hermana</EM>, 
        &quot;sister&quot;; <EM>hermano</EM> has less of a distinctively masculine 
        connotation than <EM>brother</EM> does. 
      <P> Rather than considering the breadth of the meaning of <EM>brother</EM>, 
        let's take a simpler example. It is tempting to say that <EM>casa</EM> 
        in Spanish equals <EM>house</EM> in English, like 1+1=2. 
      <BLOCKQUOTE> <EM>casa</EM> = <EM>house</EM> </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P> In fact, <EM>casa</EM> also equals <EM>home</EM>, since Spanish does 
        not distinguish between <EM>house</EM> and <EM>home</EM> with separate 
        words. (Spanish does make a similar distinction, but it does so grammatically, 
        by saying <EM>el casa</EM>, &quot;the house&quot;, contrasted with <EM>casa</EM>, 
        &quot;home&quot;.) 
      <BLOCKQUOTE> <EM>casa</EM> = <EM>home</EM> </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P> Of course, in English <EM>house</EM> and <EM>home</EM> are different. 
      <BLOCKQUOTE> <EM>house</EM> &lt;&gt; <EM>home</EM> </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P> If this is so, then: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE> <EM>casa</EM> &lt;&gt; <EM>casa</EM>. </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P> Clearly, semantics can never be reduced to an algebra of translation. 
      <P> As further evidence that words with common meanings are not exactly 
        equivalent, review some double-translations. The story is told of an American 
        in the USSR who received a telegram, <EM>Your daughter was hung for juvenile 
        crimes.</EM> In fact, the Soviet censor had translated the telegram into 
        Russian, and then back into English. The original English telegram read 
        <EM>Your daughter was suspended for delinquency.</EM> The words <EM>suspended</EM> 
        and <EM>delinquency</EM> had different prototypes (different spheres of 
        meaning) than the Russian words they were paired with. 
      <P> Words in other languages will make different distinctions. Some will 
        encompass a wider range of meanings than corresponding English words. 
        For instance, Rick Harrison's planned language Vorlin has some interesting 
        words: the basic sense of the word <EM>bat</EM> is &quot;a ball-hitting 
        tool&quot;, with its radiated meanings including &quot;bat, hockey stick, 
        and tennis racket&quot;, while the word <EM>sop</EM> means &quot;soup&quot; 
        and &quot;stew&quot;. Other Vorlin words cover a smaller range of meanings, 
        so that <EM>for</EM>, &quot;form, shape&quot;, does not include other 
        senses of English <EM>form</EM> like &quot;a paper document to be filled 
        in&quot;, &quot;a molding to be filled with concrete&quot; or &quot;manners 
        or conduct&quot;. 
      <P> As you determine what the words in your model language mean, you have 
        to keep in mind that they will not exactly equal English words. But, as 
        a practical matter, you probably don't want to create words for each separate 
        meaning of <EM>brother</EM> and have each word assigned only to that meaning, 
        like the following English words: <EM>brother german</EM> (&quot;full 
        brother&quot;), <EM>half-brother</EM>, <EM>stepbrother</EM>, <EM>brother-in-law</EM>, 
        <EM>comrade</EM>, <EM>fellow</EM>, <EM>kinsman</EM>, <EM>fraternity member</EM>, 
        <EM>coreligionist</EM>. Doing so loses much of the flexibility of <EM>brother</EM>. 
      <P> As an example, here's how I translated the different realms of <EM>brother</EM> 
        into the model language Negasi.

        </TABLE>
      </CENTER>
      <P> Translating the English word <EM>comrade</EM> into Negasi <EM>henami</EM> 
        will result in totally different associations. The Negasi view comrades 
        as close to kin, and their word that would be translated <EM>comrade</EM> 
        of course has no taint of communism. So the word <EM>henami</EM> has a 
        stronger familial association than English <EM>comrade</EM> does. While 
        an English-to-Negasi dictionary might list <EM>henami</EM> = <EM>comrade</EM>, 
        this oversimplifies the relationship between the prototypes represented 
        by each word. The words intersect; they are not mutually inclusive. 
      <P> As an aside, please note the difference between <EM>sanami</EM> and 
        <EM>sanemi</EM>. The word <EM>sanami</EM> was coined in the Nagada language, 
        so its literal meaning of &quot;near brother&quot; has been forgotten, 
        since it underwent sound change differently than <EM>sa nemi</EM> -- &quot;near 
        brother&quot; as two words -- did. This allowed the literal meaning &quot;near 
        brother&quot; to be used to coin a new word in Negasi, in this case referring 
        to &quot;a best friend&quot;, a previously absent word meaning. 
      <HR>
      <H2><A NAME="BM1c">Prototypes for the birds </A></H2>
      <P> Another useful example to describe semantic prototypes or semantic stereotypes 
        is birds: the prototypical bird has feathers and wings and can fly. Yet 
        penguins, ostriches and Big Bird are considered birds, even though they 
        can't fly. A duck-billed platypus, on the other hand, isn't considered 
        a bird, despite the fact that it lays eggs and has a beak; it is not considered 
        a bird since it has no feathers, no wings and can't fly. 
      <P> Prototypes are also a more useful way to describe meaning than semantic 
        primitives, because prototypes embrace the connotations of a word, rather 
        than just the denotations. The notion of prototypes can be used to show 
        how words overlap. For instance, the following table roughly summarizes 
        different types of body builds:

      <P> The words <EM>skinny</EM> and <EM>scrawny</EM> as meanings are subsets 
        of <EM>thin</EM>; <EM>plump</EM>, <EM>chubby</EM> and <EM>obese</EM> are 
        subsets of <EM>fat</EM>. Noticeably absent are any words for average weight. 
        English, like many languages, rarely has words to describe midpoints, 
        only extremes. 
      <P> Words are often grouped together like this in semantic networks. However, 
        these word sets can be exceedingly complicated. For instance, the words 
        used to describe body builds each have complex connotations as part of 
        their prototypes: <EM>plump</EM> is used more often to describe food such 
        as meat and fruits than <EM>fat</EM> is; similarly, <EM>chubby</EM> is 
        more often used for little boys (or girls) than <EM>fat</EM> is. The word 
        <EM>scrawny</EM> also suggests <EM>bony</EM>; there are other words not 
        shown on this list that also have connotations and specific uses, like 
        <EM>lean</EM>, which suggests &quot;muscular&quot;, and <EM>slim</EM>, 
        which suggests &quot;tall&quot;, and <EM>slender</EM>, which suggests 
        &quot;graceful&quot;. Connotations are not specified in dictionaries and 
        are rarely articulated. 
      <P> Besides connotations, there are habits governing what other words to 
        use with a word. The synonyms <EM>pursue</EM> and <EM>chase</EM> are almost 
        interchangeable, except that <EM>pursue</EM> is preferred when the object 
        to be chased is highly desirable - <EM>pursue truth, pursue wisdom, pursue 
        happiness</EM>, but <EM>chase a thief, chase a bus, chase a fox</EM>. 
        You could write an essay on the difference between <EM>he pursued love</EM> 
        and <EM>he chased love</EM>. 
      <P> Obviously, it is very difficult to translate these prototypes from one 
        language to another. Failure to properly account for the radius of meaning 
        of a word often has comical results, as evidenced by this sign in a Bucharest 
        hotel lobby: <EM>The lift is being fixed for the next day. During the 
        time we regret that you will be unbearable.</EM> Historically speaking, 
        the word <EM>unbearable</EM> had began with a strict literal meaning, 
        but over time its radius of meaning had expanded to include a figurative 
        sense as well. The combinations of connotations and detailed usage preferences 
        for any word are not articulated, but mastering them is one of the hallmarks 
        of literary writing.

      <P> Meaning is therefore a combination of prototypical examples. The important 
        thing to keep in mind, when creating your own languages, is that the words 
        you invent will not exactly equal the English words you define them as. 
        While, for practical purposes, you will define most words very straightforwardly 
        in English, you will want to highlight the unique culture of your language's 
        speakers by noting how the range of meanings and the range of possible 
        uses distinguishes your invented lexicon from English words. 
      <P> No wonder Suzanne Vega sang, &quot;I won't use words again. They don't 
        mean what I meant. They don't say what I said.&quot;
