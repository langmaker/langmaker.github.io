      <BLOCKQUOTE> <CITE>Nobody believes me when I say that my long book [The 
        Lord of the Rings] is an attempt to create a world in which a form of 
        language agreeable to my personal aesthetic might seem real. But it is 
        true. An enquirer (among many) asked what the L.R. was all about, and 
        whether it was an allegory. And I said it was an effort to create a situation 
        in which a common greeting would be </CITE><EM>elen si-'la lu-'menn omentielmo</EM><CITE> 
        ['A star shines on the hour of our meeting'], and that the phrase long 
        antedated the book.</CITE> </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <H4 align=right>Letter from <EM>J.R.R. Tolkien</EM> to Christopher Tolkien, 
        Feb. 21, 1958</H4>
      <P> Model languages come in many different sizes and types. You can classify 
        a model language both for its scope and for who is intended to speak it. 
      <UL>
        <LI><A href="ml0103b.htm#2a1">Classifying by scope</A> 
        <LI><A href="ml0103b.htm#2a2">Classifying by time-frame of speakers</A>

      </UL>
      <HR width=75%>
      <H2><A NAME="BM2a1">Classifying by scope</A> </H2>
      <P> For different scales, a model language might be used for jargon, names, 
        proverbs, conversations or literature. Each layer of complexity requires 
        a more detailed lexicon and grammar, ranging from a jargon consisting 
        of a handful of words and a way of forming plurals to a complex language 
        that can be used to carry on a conversation or support a literature. 
      <P> Most of the model languages that have gained recognition have been intended 
        for use as true languages, but many other model languages of smaller scale 
        exist within works of fiction. Few writers can create an entire language, 
        as Tolkien or Anthony Burgess did; few writers need that much detail in 
        the first place. 
      <P> When trying to decide what model language to create, you should not 
        be intimidated by the magnitude of the works accomplished by Tolkien or 
        Burgess -- that would be like fearing to write a short story because you 
        had read <EM>War and Peace</EM>. 
      <P> Creating a language for jargon simply means you are only interested 
        in having a few words to convey the flavor of another culture. A model 
        jargon is rarely even dignified with a name, since it is so small. A science-fiction 
        author might coin a few words for unusual aliens and new technologies. 
        For instance, I do not recall much linguistically about Larry Niven's 
        <EM>Ringworld</EM>, other than to remember that he coined the word <EM>tang</EM>, 
        &quot;there ain't no justice&quot;, as the curse word used by his characters; 
        no doubt he had coined other words to reflect the technology and topography 
        of Ringworld and to enhance its ambience. 
      <HR width=75%>
      <H2><A NAME="BM2a2">Classifying by time-frame of speakers</A> </H2>
      <P> Besides classifying a model language by its use, you can classify a 
        language by whether the people who speak it are alive today or are an 
        imagined people of the past or future. A model language might be intended 
        to represent the language of a people who lived in the remote past. It 
        might be intended as a linguistic experiment, showing how a language might 
        have evolved if the past had been changed (alternate past). A model language 
        is commonly something intended for use in the present, such as Esperanto. 
        Finally, it might be set in a future world, such as Burgess' Nadsat or 
        Marc Okrand's Klingon.

      <H2><A NAME="BM2a3">Classifying model languages</A> </H2>
      <P> The following chart illustrates one way of classifying some popular 
        languages. Most of those languages listed under &quot;Present&quot; and 
        &quot;Literature&quot; are meant as auxiliary languages or international 
        languages, designed to be learned as a common second language.

      <H2><A NAME="BM2b">Ideas for model languages</A> </H2>
      <P> What follows are some ideas drawn from across the above classification 
        matrix, to encourage you to create your own model language. 
      <UL>
        <LI><A href="ml0103b.htm#2b1">Naming languages</A> 
        <LI><A href="ml0103b.htm#2b2">Alternate languages</A> 
        <LI><A href="ml0103b.htm#2b3">Future languages</A> 
        <LI><A href="ml0103b.htm#2b4">Auxiliary languages</A> 
      </UL>
      <HR width=75%>
      <H2><A NAME="BM2b1">Naming languages</A></H2>
      <P> A naming language is a model language created primarily for the purpose 
        of naming people, places and things in an imaginary country or world. 
        It is the simplest type of language to create, since it doesn't need a 
        detailed grammar. The last issue provided an overview on how to create 
        such a language. 
      <HR width=75%>
      <H2><A NAME="BM2b2">Alternate languages</A></H2>
      <P> Science fiction contains a sub-genre of literature known as the alternate 
        history, which postulates worlds that never existed, but might have. What 
        if William the Conquerer, instead of Harold, had fallen at Hastings? What 
        if the French Quebecois and their English neighbors had assimilated? What 
        if the Moors had not stopped at Spain but had conquered England? Alternate 
        universes such as these suggest languages that might have emerged but 
        didn't -- these alternate universes are ripe for the creation of model 
        languages. 
      <P> If William the Conqueror and his Norman troops had failed to conquer 
        the Anglo-Saxons, the English language would have taken a different course 
        altogether. English would have retained much more of its vocabulary, which 
        instead was largely displaced by Norman French. Since an Anglo- English 
        would have retained much of its vocabulary, it might have proven more 
        resistant to borrowing foreign terms. Anglo-English syntax would depend 
        more on inflections, for English lost the Anglo-Saxon inflectional endings 
        under pressure from Norman French, which had a different system of inflections 
        all together. Anglo-English would be a fascinating language indeed. (If 
        anyone out there wants to be the Ivar Aasen of English, let me know.) 
      <P> If the French- and English-speaking people of Quebec had been less interested 
        in preserving their own backgrounds and more interested in building a 
        community together, a new Gallic-English might have evolved as the two 
        languages merged. This new language would have an even simpler grammar 
        than English, as speakers concentrated on the distinctions that French 
        and English had in common. 
      <P> The Moors expanded from North Africa to conquer much of the Iberian 
        Peninsula. Had al-Mansur been able to forge a kingdom that would have 
        survived his death (rather than degenerate into quarelling taifas), the 
        Moors might have tried to invade England, giving rise to a Moorish English. 
      <P> Alternative languages are fun to think about, and you should always 
        be able to come up with one moor version of English. 
      <HR width=75%>
      <H2><A NAME="BM2b3">Future languages</A></H2>
      <P> The model linguist need not stop at the past or imagined alternate pasts. 
        He can move to the future, postulating languages that might come to exist. 
      <P> For instance, the Roman Empire spread Latin across Europe. As the Empire 
        declined, the farflung local speakers of Latin slowly changed the language 
        they had learned from Rome. As a result, Latin evolved into Italian, French, 
        Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian, Sardinian, Catalan, Rhaetian, Occitan and 
        Dalamation (now extinct). A different type of empire has risen today, 
        the cultural empire of English. English is now spoken as the mother tongue 
        in Britain, the United States, Canada, Guyana, Australia and New Zealand. 
        Over time, the dialects of English spoken in these areas may diverge as 
        much as Italian, Spanish and French diverged from Latin, giving rise to 
        new languages, based on English, but different from it. English has already 
        given rise to new Englishes, such as Krio (an African creole) and Singlish 
        (Singaporean English). 
      <P> The great thing about constructing a future English is that you already 
        know English! You have already mastered its vocabulary and grammar and 
        can postulate how you would like to see those evolve in a future descendant 
        of English. 
      <HR width=75%>
      <H2><A NAME="BM2b4">Auxiliary languages</A></H2>
      <P> Anyone who has traveled extensively through foreign countries wishes 
        there was one language she could learn that people everywhere could speak. 
        English comes close, but carries with it a cultural baggage that many 
        find oppressive or offensive. From Volapu:k to Esperanto to Interlingua, 
        people have struggled to create languages to make it easier to bring people 
        together. Nor are these efforts in the past. For instance, Phil Hunt is 
        creating Eurolang, which he hopes to position as the common language of 
        the European Union. 
      <P> It is easy to think of situations where simplified bridge languages 
        would be beneficial to people -- to Quebec and to the U.S./Mexico border, 
        to give two North American examples. While the practical steps required 
        to see that an auxiliary language establishes a significant community 
        of speakers are daunting, you can always choose to create such a language 
        as simply a fascinating linguistic exercise, rather than a new social 
        movement. 
      <HR width=75%>
      <P> The possibilities for model languages are endless. Timothy Miller has 
        been entertaining CONLANG subscribers with his Monkey Language, and he 
        is also developing a Ferengi language for Star Trek fans (the Ferengi 
        are the big-eared aliens, in case you didn't know). The possibilities 
        are endless, so get working on your language today!
