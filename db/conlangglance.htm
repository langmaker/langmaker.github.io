<font face="serif" size="2"><p>Descended from Primitive Elvish, <b><a href="mdl_quenya.htm">Quenya</a></b> is the chief of Tolkien's Elvish languages, used mainly in The Lord of The Rings and The Silmarillion. The beauty of Quenya has inspired many to take up the hobby of model languages. Unfortunately, it was never a primary goal of Tolkien's to finish the design of Quenya, and his death left the vocabulary and grammar incomplete. This incompleteness has dampened the fires of enthusiasm for many who would have liked to have learned the language. At present there exists no single authoritative reference to the meta-history (the history of the creation of the fictional history) of Quenya. This gap will be filled eventually, when some unknown among us rises to the challenge of analyzing the editorial efforts of Tolkien's son, who has prepared a series of volumes relating the history of Tolkien's invention of Middle Earth. [Since I first wrote that in 1995, Helge Kåre Fauskanger has come close to achieving this.]</p></font>

<font face="serif" size="2"><p>You won't find a personal language being actively developed that is as deep and rich as <b><a href="mdl_teonaht.htm">Teonaht</a></b>. Much is unique about it, from its word order to its verbal system to its affixing. It uses the rare OSV word order, can front the subject (SOV), yet repeats the pronoun before the verb. While a nominative language, Teonaht distinguishes between "volitional" and "non-volitional" verbs and subjects, so that the nominative has two forms, "agent" and "experiencer," also reflected in the verbs. Teonaht lacks the copula in the present tense. It has "the Law of Detachment," whereby affixes can switch from final to initial position in a word for rhetorical or prosodic purposes; this allows the tense suffix to detach and prefix the pronoun (an innovation copied by NGL). While putatively Indo-European, Teonaht draws very heavily from an unknown inflected language called "Nenddeyly".</p><center><b>Eskkoat ol ai sendran, rohsan nuehra celyil takrem bomai nakuo.</b></center><center><i>My shadow follows me, putting strange, new roses into the world.</i></center></font>

It has a vocabulary based primarily on English and German roots that have been somewhat simplified for ease of pronunciation and morphological analysis. Its grammar was difficult enough that enthusiasts were rarely able to actually learn to speak the language. The language was successfully reformed in the 1930s. If Esperanto is the GUI (Graphical User Interface) of auxiliary languages, than Volapük is the DOS of the field. The language is primarily of interest now for historical reasons.</p></font>
