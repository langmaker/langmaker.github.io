<p><a href="alp_12480.htm">12480</a> - "12480 is not based upon phonemes, but rather upon binary. It achieves complete universality with an optimal amount of applications from its binary basis. A writing system based on phonemes will only last as long as the human voice is used. 12480's binary foundation will last as long as numbers exist."  --from <a href="https://www.omniglot.com/writing/12480.htm">Omniglot.com</a></p>

<p><a href="alp_ahlimite.htm">Ahlimite</a></p>
<p><a href="alp_aiur.htm">Aiur</a> - I invented a rough form of this language in 4th grade  for passing notes to my friends during class. It was so much fun I have  been using it ever since. Of course it has changed significantly since  then.</p>
<p><a href="alp_albireothai.htm">Albireo-Thai</a></p>
<p><a href="alp_almeryan.htm">Almeryan</a> - An Elven script from East Almery.</p>
<p><a href="alp_alomian.htm">Alomian</a> - "The Alomian script is the creation of Dan Baisden.... It is named after one of the Incan gods and is designed to be quick and easy to write. Reading it is more difficult however."  --from <a href="https://www.omniglot.com/writing/alomian.htm">Omniglot.com</a></p>
<p><a href="alp_alphabet26.htm">Alphabet 26</a> - Alphabet 26 is Bradbury Thompson's radical proposal for the redesign of the alphabet... The plan for simplifying and improving our alphabet, entitled 'Alphabet 26,' was first presented in <i>Westvaco Inspirations 180</i> in 1950. It recommended the use of only one symbol for each of the 26 letters. Our conventional alphabet contains 19 letters having dissimilar upper and lower case symbols (such as 'A' and 'a') and 7 letters (c-o-s-v-w-x-z) having symbols that are identical.  It is misleading for a letter, or for any graphic symbol, to have two different designs. Confusion might set in when school children are taught to recognize words even before they have learned to recognize different symbols for the same letter.  To remedy this, Alphabet 26, a plan based upon the logic of consistency, proposed that of the 19 letters that have dissimilar symbols 15 letters should use the uppercase designs [black letters below] and 4 letters should use the lowercase designs ! [green letters]. The other 7 letters already have identical symbols [blue letters]. Alphabet 26 provides the necessary large letters for emphasis at the beginning of the sentence and for denoting proper nouns, an advantage over the exclusive use of an all lowercase alphabet, as recommended at the Bauhaus.</p>
<p><a href="alp_alphadozen.htm">Alphadozen</a> - Alternative English alphabet made to harmonize with duodecimal numbers.</p>
<p><a href="alp_alphanian.htm">Alphanian</a></p>
<p><a href="alp_aluiul.htm">Aluiul</a> - This is a 'simple' alphabet for a rather unusual hypothetical language.  All its consonants are alveolar or closely related to alveolar, but it uses a lot of variations and several different articulation manners.  It has a simple vowel system.  Syllable-final consonants have their own shapes, distinct from the syllable-initial versions with the same sound.</p>
<p><a href="alp_aluwxn.htm">Aluwxn</a> - Aluwxn is basically 6 symbols which can be rotated to generate 22 letters.  The addition of a dot generates another 22 letters.  The 6 symbols can be put onto a cubical die and cast for divination purposes.</p>
<p><a href="alp_anemonian.htm">Anemonian</a> - Anemonian is the printed form of Anemonian Longhand, thus the latter is more syllabary-like. (Anemonia is a stormy island off the north-eastern coast of Mathasia, the name means the "windy" country.)</p>
<p><a href="alp_anemonianlonghand.htm">Anemonian Longhand</a> - Anemonia is a stormy island off the north-eastern coast of Mathasia; the name means the "windy" country.</p>
<p><a href="alp_anterian.htm">Anterian</a></p>
<p><a href="alp_anthroposian.htm">Anthroposian</a> - Anthroposian or NeoHebrew is written right to left, like Earth Hebrew.</p>
<p><a href="alp_arborianfairyscript.htm">Arborian Fairy Script</a> - Of the words in the samples, Altaria is a kind of dragon bird (another connection! it is a Pokémon from Nintendo's game, and it is indeed a dragon bird, even in the game).  Derwen is the proper name of the Entish leader of the northern neighboring country of Arboria, which is called Zundborn.</p>
<p><a href="alp_arborianscript.htm">Arborian Script</a></p>
<p><a href="alp_arenian.htm">Arenian</a> - Arenian is an abjad, created from the Latin alphabet, by reverting to the Latin script's Semitic roots, but keeping the modern shapes (some extra letters have also been added, to cater to Semitic and Indic sounds). There are also vowel marks as in Arabic.</p>
<p><a href="alp_arialthai.htm">Arial.Thai</a> - Arial-Thai is a linearized version of Thai.  The consonants are taken directly from Thai (though a few have received new pronounciations), but many of the vowels and the tone marks are invented. The name comes from the fact that the characters were made from the Arial (42 point) typeface. The vowels cannot stand by themselves; if there is no consonant to attach a vowel to, the glottal stop character (reverse "G") must be used.</p>
<p><a href="alp_ascenderati.htm">Ascenderati</a></p>
<p><a href="alp_ascolanian.htm">Ascolanian</a> - The writing system from Ascolais.</p>
<p><a href="alp_atemayarqelisayer.htm">Atemayar Qelisayér</a> - "The Atemayar alphabet was created by Simon Halfdan Hvilshøj Andersen-Garnéro during a boring Latin classes at school. He wanted a language that sounded Arabic, thus the large amount of words with Q and guttural sounds."  --from <a href="https://www.omniglot.com/writing/atemayar.htm">Omniglot.com</a></p>
<p><a href="alp_atlantean.htm">Atlantean</a> - Atlantean was created for the film <i>Atlantis - the Lost Empire</i>.  It is written in boustrofedon fashion: one row goes from right to left, and the next one goes from left to right; oddly, the letters are not mirrored when the writing direction is changed.  "The Atlantean A is a shape developed by John Emerson. It is a miniature map of the city of Atlantis (i.e., the outside of the swirl is the cave, the inside shape is the silhouette of the city, and the dot is the location of the crystal).  It's a treasure map." - Kirk Wise, <i>Atlantis: The Lost Empire - The Illustrated Script (Abridged)</i>, p. 82</p>
<p><a href="alp_attrendian.htm">Attrendian</a> - I developed the Attrendian alphabet initially as a "code" based upon the English alphabet.  However, as I developed Attrendian I adopted the symbols to the unique sounds of Attrendian.  The alphabet consists of a formal, more classical character set and a script set for everyday writing.  The formal character set (the larger, more detailed symbols) is used most often in creating vertical titles on documents, while the script set (the quickly written smaller symbols) is used in writing the actual contents of the document.</p>
<p><a href="alp_avallaen.htm">Avallaen</a> - "The Avallaen alphabet is the creation of Thomas Maska...and is modelled, to some extent, on the the script of the Voynich Manuscript. Thomas created the alphabet to write his conlang, also known as Avallaen."  --from <a href="https://www.omniglot.com/writing/avallaen.htm">Omniglot.com</a></p>
<p><a href="alp_awashi.htm">Awashi</a></p>
<p><a href="alp_awota.htm">Awota</a> - Awota Kørøk (Kørøk means writing) is a 'reverse' abugida, that is, the vowel is the most important part of the symbol, and the consonant is added (in the case of Awota, on the top) as a kind of 'diacritic'.</p>
<p><a href="alp_ayeri.htm">Ayeri</a> - This is a script for my constructed language Ayeri which I  came up with in spring 2004. It is intended for artful purposes actually,  such as ornaments or ornamentally designed titles over writings, etc.</p>
<p><a href="alp_azalonian.htm">Azalonian</a> - The writing system from Azalone (Eta Bootis IV).</p>
