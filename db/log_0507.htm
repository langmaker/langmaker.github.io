Also the consonants do not change their shapes depending on which vowel they are used with."</blockquote>If that's the case, then aren't most of the Indic scripts considered abjads then? The vowel diacritics are completely independent (for the most part, in many of the insular scripts they are such as in the Tagalog script) of what consonant they are used with, and the consonants don't change their shapes either. <br><br>I thought that abjads were consonantal alphabets that had <i>optional</i> vowel marking, and anything that required vowel marks was classed as an abugida?  So, if <a href="/db/alp_latheb.htm">Latheb</a> has optional vowel marking, then yes, I can agree with Matthias. But if it's used and needed, then I agree with Ethan Dickey's assertion that it's an abugida.</blockquote>Actually, abugidas can be thought of as regularized syllabaries where each symbol represents a consonant-vowel pair and where all symbols represent syllables with a single base vowel.  To override this inherent vowel and specify a different vowel (or no vowel, for consonant clusters), diacritics must be used.  Since Latheb symbols do not have an inherent vowel (e.g., Latheb 'K' represents /k/ not, for instance, /ka/), the Latheb writing system is an abjad.</font></div><br><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#006699" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="KaorChaos"></a>Kaor, Chaos<small> - 7/24/05 - 7:27 pm</small></font><div><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a href="/db/mdl_laadan.htm">Suzette Haden Elgin</a> in <a href="https://www.livejournal.com/users/ozarque/">her blog</a> <img src="/db/externallink.png" border=0> recently introduced me to <a href="https://tenser.typepad.com/tenser_said_the_tensor/">Tenser, said the Tensor</a> <img src="/db/externallink.png" border=0>, who has a subcategory of posts called <a href="https://tenser.typepad.com/tenser_said_the_tensor/linguistics_in_sf/index.html">Linguistics in SF</a> <img src="/db/externallink.png" border=0>, which led me to his appropriate criticisms of <a href="https://tenser.typepad.com/tenser_said_the_tensor/2004/06/barsoomian_lang.html">Barsoomian language</a> <img src="/db/externallink.png" border=0>.

One item omitted from the several obituaries I read was Mr. Doohan's role in creating <a href="/db/mdl_klingon.htm">Klingon</a>, here summarized by Marc Okrand:<blockquote>The Klingon dialogue in <i>Star Trek: The Motion Picture</i> was devised by James Doohan and spoken by Mark Lenard, who, of course, played the Klingon commander in that film. My understanding is that Doohan recorded the dialogue on tape and Lenard then listened to the tape and wrote down what he heard in a way that would help him learn the lines. To the best of my knowledge, Lenard's handwritten transcription of this tape is the only written version of what Doohan made up. (There was more made up than actually ended up in the film. Some of this additional dialogue can be heard -- though without benefit of subtitles -- in a scene where we see the Klingon commander on a viewscreen on a Federation monitoring station. But the Federation folks are talking though all of this, so the Klingon dialogue can't be heard very clearly.) I don't know whether at the time Doohan made the recording he or Lenard or anybody else knew which phrases would go with which subtitles or whether subtitles were changed after the filming was done. (Having said that, the command meaning "fire [a torpedo]!" -- which I transcribed as {baH} but which sounds kind of like {maH} -- must have always had that meaning, since it's there a couple of times. [The {H} is pronounced like the final {ch} in the name of the composer Bach.])</blockquote>Out of all his Star Trek scenes, one of the most poignant is when Scotty's nephew is killed in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079945/">Star Trek: The Motion Picture</a>.

Unfortunately, we don't have enough visitors to create ratings of much reliability (heck, only <a href="/db/bks_index_rating.htm#2">14 of our 187 books have ratings</a>).  With 1,414 conlangs as I write this, I realized I would need an automated rating system.<br><br>Accordingly, last year, I came up with a methodology for rating the web presence of each conlang.  I further refined that methodology this week (frankly because it rated a number of my conlangs too high, leading me to add two factors to the calculations, and lower their ratings in the process!).  My unachieved goal was to have the methodology fairly evenly distribute 5-star ratings, coming up with the same number of 5-star, 4.5-star, 4.0-star, 3.5-star ratings, etc.  In other words, conlangs are graded to the curve. <br><br>For the rest of the year, I will highlight a <a href="/db/mdl_star200_2005.htm">Conlang Star of the Day</a> on the home page.  Each subsequent day's language will have a slightly higher rating than the one the day before.  As the reviews progress, let me know if you disagree with the ratings, and why, so that I can fine-tune the algorithm.  Right now the rating system takes into account 12 factors;  over time, I will add a few more.<br><br>At the end of the year, I will unveil the ratings for all the conlangs and put them on their profiles.  Next year, ratings will be dynamically calculated and will change frequently, even if you haven't changed your web site or conlang-profile listing.<br><br>Finally, the algorithm isn't rating the language:  just the web presence of the language.  Build a more thorough web site and your conlang will get a better rating, even if it is the blandest Esperantido.<br><br>As always, the primary goal of Langmaker.com is to encourage interest in one another's conlangs.

With over 1,400 conlangs in the directory now, it's important to me to direct your attention to noteworthy languages.</li><li>Finally, so that the site would constantly appear fresh (which is also the reason for the random elements on right pane of the home page), especially during those times when I'm too busy to update it.</li></ul>I decided to count down the Top 200 this year instead of the Top 100 because it would get me halfway through the year (I think I started the year featuring <a href="/db/mdl_cyberyak.htm">#183</a> on the home page).<br><br>Tune in tomorrow to see what will carry us through the rest of the year, while still meeting my three goals above.</font></div><br><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#006699" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="TopThis"></a>Top This<small> - 7/11/05 - 8:14 am</small></font><div><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a href="/db/mdl_index_languageauthor.htm#DavidJPeterson">David J.

Well, I went about creating some example tags.  First, though, I did an edit of the Langmaker logo.  The letters were kind of blocky, so I touched them up a little.  I'm no expert at that kind of stuff, but I think it's an improvement.  I created images for the Top 10, Top 100, and Top 200.</blockquote>Thanks to David for doing this!

It was pretty naïve.  Its words were mainly derived from English etymons, and I rewrote the etymologies so that Latin roots were said to derive from Imperial Northish, Old English roots were said to derive from Old Alfish, and so on.  Really Karklak's only claim to uniqueness was that the two genders were "offensive gender" and "defensive gender": <i>kraz</i>, "sword", had offensive gender, where <i>grev</i> - [FA <i>greve</i> < N or GT <i>greve</i> < OA <i>reof</i>.] "leg armor" - had defensive gender.

For some linguistic fun this morning, here's H.L. Mencken's translation of the Declaration of Independence into 1920s colloquial American English:<blockquote> When things get so balled up that the people of a country have to cut loose from some other country, and go it on their own hook, without asking no permission from nobody, excepting maybe God Almighty, then they ought to let everybody know why they done it, so that everybody can see they are on the level, and not trying to put nothing over on nobody.<br><br>All we got to say on this proposition is this: first, you and me is as good as anybody else, and maybe a damn sight better; second, nobody aint got no right to take away none of our rights; third, every man has got a right to live, to come and go as he pleases, and to have a good time however he likes, so long as he dont interfere with nobody else. That any government that dont give a man these rights aint worth a damn; also, people ought to choose the kind of goverment they want themselves, and nobody else ought to have no say in the matter. That whenever any goverment dont do this, then the people have got a right to can it and put in one that will take care of their interests. Of course, that dont mean having a revolution every day like them South American coons and yellow-bellies and Bolsheviki, or every time some job-holder does something he aint got no business to do. It is better to stand a little graft, etc., than to have revolutions all the time, like them coons and Bolsheviki, and any man that wasnt a anarchist or one of them I. W. W.s would say the same. But when things get so bad that a man aint hardly got no rights at all no more, but you might almost call him a slave, then everybody ought to get together and throw the grafters out, and put in new ones who wont carry on so high and steal so much, and then watch them. This is the proposition the people of these Colonies is up against, and they have got tired of it, and wont stand it no more. The administration of the present King, George III, has been rotten from the start, and when anybody kicked about it he always tried to get away with it by strong-arm work.
