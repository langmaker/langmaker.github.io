<dt><a href="mdl_allnoun.htm">AllNoun</a></dt>
<dd>This language attempts to be as true to its name as possible, containing primarily nouns. Created by Tom Breton, AllNoun does, however, use four operators as part of its grammar. Breton has primarily specified the grammar of the language (which resembles a simple programming language and in fact has been modified by Breton for use as such); he uses English primarily to illustrate the noun vocabulary. Very atypical, AllNoun is good inspiration for a fictional language for aliens.  [Tom Breton]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_asdste100.htm">ASD-STE100</a></dt>
<dd>A controlled language is a subset of a natural language. A controlled language is used to ensure that there is no ambiguity in a text. One  controlled language is ASD-STE100 (formerly AECMA Simplified English). It  has been used in the aircraft industry since 1986. The web article explains  the basics of ASD-STE100 and contains links to resources.</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_asht.htm">Asht</a></dt>
<dd>True lack of ambiguity, not only in syntax but also in a truly phonetic alphabet. Machine readable and well thought through(no diphthongs, no vowel iteration).  [SPH]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_chinyntheuk.htm">Chin'yn-theuk</a></dt>
<dd>[script]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_classicalyiklamu.htm">Classical Yiklamu</a></dt>
<dd>Its purpose is to enable interested users to explore the possibilities of highly disambiguated verbal communication. The unusual degree of disambiguation provided by the language derives from its lexicon, which was created by associating stem forms to the over 90,000 thesaurus entries of WordNet 1.6.  [Mark P. Line]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_danovenaroven.htm">Danovën/Arovën</a></dt>
<dd>Arovën means "language of thought" and is intended as a medium for clear, precise translation of thoughts from one mind to another.  It is logical in the sense of syntactically unambiguous, but does not impose logic upon the speaker.  The site contains a grammar and sample texts.  [Joshua Shinavier]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_dashul.htm">Dashul</a></dt>
<dd>A new concept in logical languages, Dashul follows the epistemological theory that words are perceptual concretizations of concepts, and that concepts are based on the integration of perceptual data.  It therefore recognizes entities, attributes, actions, etc. as what they are, and develops a syntactic grammar based on logical principles.  [Anthony Raymond Bullard]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_dren.htm">Dren</a></dt>
<dd>Its frame is rigid and simple, and therefore, easy to learn, but the frame naturally allows for abstracts, art, and higher thinking (using an element-like basis), as well as literal thinking if needed. Though this is not entirely a unique effort, the language strives to be logical, removing as many ambiguities--making a good candidate for auxiliary communication--as possible, mostly using English as an example of what NOT to be. This language, because of its basic logical structure, allows such a task perfectly.  Something fairly unique would be its stressing pattern. Instead of defining a specific way to stress every single word, the structure simply suggests you use blank verse (like Shakespeare's iambic pentameter). Of course, you could stress words any way you please, because it does nothing to change the meaning of the word, only the sentence.  [Thomas McInturf]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_guaspi.htm">gua!spi</a></dt>
<dd>Jim Carter has prepared his own logical language, inspired by Loglan and Lojban. He feels he has simplified the deep structures in Loglan enough to make them 100 times easier to learn.  [Jim Carter]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_kalabax.htm">Kalaba-X</a></dt>
<dd>Kalaba-X is nothing more than a formalized grammatical description [verb (modifier) object (modifier) subject (modifier)], yet Pike makes excellent use of it to teach some of the challenges of translation, as he translates material to and from Kalaba-X. This is a must-read for anyone designing the grammar of a constructed language; this article is one of a series of four articles posted at this site (I, II, III, IV).  [Kenneth L. Pike]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_kel.htm">Kel</a></dt>
<dd>Kel is a logical language that aims to eliminate all ambiguity, irregularity, and idiomatic usage of language. It has a small phonology and a very regular morphology and syntax with powerful derivational and semantically precise compounding systems. The vocabulary is <i>a priori</i>, and the trashing of the system of recognition at first sight for west Europeans makes the vocabulary fairer to learn, ensures words lack idiomatic baggage, and hugely reduces the number of possible pseudo-cognates. Currently under revision.  [Robert Jung]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_ladekwa.htm">Ladekwa</a></dt>
<dd>Specifically intended for use as an interlingua in machine translation, and to be as easy as possible to learn regardless of the native language of the student.  [Rick Morneau]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_lifesound.htm">Life Sound</a></dt>
<dd>The peace language models an existent language that is spoken by all children, usually until the tribal language dominates and the naturally existent one belongs exclusively to the sub-concious. This explanation is also unique. Others exist, as in myth, once all the animals could speak .... as before there were spoken many languages, there was spoken one among all the people .... as J.Weilgart at the age of five learned this language from a space-butterfly.  [mikulzqm]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_liva.htm">Liva</a></dt>
<dd>Phonology follows a weird symmetrical scheme. Phonotactics is designed to obtain unambiguous word segmentation. Morphology is originally isolating, and tends to become agglutinative at a higher level. Syntax is based on predicate logic (as in Lojban) with a special role for deictics. Stems are (or will be) generated randomly.  [Claudio Gnoli]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_livagian.htm">Livagian</a></dt>
<dd>Claudio Gnoli writes, "[Livagian is] the language spoken in the imaginary land of Livagia, with a very uncommon phonology and highly sophisticated logical grammar devices."  [And Rosta]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_loglan.htm">Loglan</a></dt>
<dd>Brown designed Loglan (short for "Logical Language") to test the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis through use of a language that followed the concepts and structures of symbolic logic, while striving for a thoroughly unambiguous grammar. Brown's original language has served as the foundation for at least two other logical languages, -gua!spi and Lojban.  [James Cooke Brown]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_logsan.htm">Logsan</a></dt>
<dd>Logsan is a language which aims to be logical as well as easily speakable. It uses its own script, although it can be perfectly  transliterated into Roman script.  [Filip Skwarski]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_logulos.htm">Logulos</a></dt>
<dd>[Shawn C. Knight]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_lojban.htm">Lojban</a></dt>
<dd>Designed by others as a continuation of Loglan, Lojban (its name is a contraction for "Logical Language" in Lojban) is the most professional and thought-provoking of the modern logical languages, with a fascinating methodology for deriving its root words from Arabic, Chinese, English, Hindi, Russian and Spanish. Extensive information is available on-line. For the sheer joy of it, you should check out how Tolkien's Tengwar alphabet can provide "a romantic orthography for Lojban".  [The Logical Language Group]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_lojsk.htm">Lojsk</a></dt>
<dd>Lojsk is the formation of an absolutely regular Predicate-Based logical language in the style of Loglan and Lojban. But unlike its parent languages, Lojsk utilizes a flexible and powerful Relationship Morpheme (known as GRARs) to piece the language together.  The language is still in development, including the expansion of an ever robust vocabulary, which Lojsk doesn't shy away from, unlike other conlangs.  [Ariano Reyes]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_matsui.htm">Matsui</a></dt>
<dd>Matsui is a language designed by a teenager, originally to satisfy a nation for an MMORPG, but then it evolved into a simplified  language with the intent of having very few ways of saying things.  Except for a few words, the lexicon resembles nothing of the actual  lexicon of any living language, except perhaps by coincidence.  [Ray Flores]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_minyeva.htm">Minyeva</a></dt>
<dd>Malat is intended to be the most logical a language can be, in both regularity and in expression. It also allows some relatively complicated concepts to be said in a relatively simple and unambiguous manner. All the vocabulary is arbitrarily made and unrelated to natural languages.  [Garrett Jones]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_mua.htm">Mua</a></dt>
<dd>[Valentin Koulikov]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_mul.htm">MUL</a></dt>
<dd>Uses only monosyllabic words, and minimal grammar which is expandable if clarification is necessary. Simplicity; getting the point across as efficiently as possible.  [Michael Cartier]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_ododu.htm">ODODU</a></dt>
<dd>It is designed to evolve in a pragmatic manner, so that it will eventually become a true universal language.  All words will ideally be derivable from our own experience and interaction with others.  [Jere Northrop]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_planb.htm">Plan B</a></dt>
<dd>Claudio Gnoli writes, "A radical approach to the mapping of morphologic and syntactical functions onto optimally concise and self-segregating sequences of characters. Information science style makes it looking very exotic as a language, but it includes important solutions to deep problems."  [J. Prothero]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_planc.htm">Plan C</a></dt>
<dd>A parody of Plan B.  [Jacques Guy]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_rikchik.htm">Rikchik</a></dt>
<dd>Logographic alien sign language.  Unspeakable by humans.  Versatile structure.  [Denis Moskowitz]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_simple.htm">SIMPLE</a></dt>
<dd>A simplified English, with about a 500-word vocabulary. Unlike Basic English, SIMPLE does not aim to be a grammatical subset of English, but attempts to simplify the rules. The SIMPLE language is not so simple, for it does not formally specify its grammar (which appears to consist of some arguable but complex subset of English), it idiomatically forms new words that have to be learned (a'other, there-for), it ignores the issues of polysemy, and it permits a full range of verbal idioms (verb-preposition pairs: give up, put up, go in, etc.).</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_tilya.htm">Tilya</a></dt>
<dd>Claudio Gnoli writes, "A 'verbal' language based on predicate logic, with both mandatory and optional arguments."  [Herman Miller]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_universaltranslationl.htm">Universal Translation Language</a></dt>
<dd>Claudio Gnoli writes, "A language derived from Esperanto, with unambiguous syntax to be used for machine translation."</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_varaq.htm">Var'aq</a></dt>
<dd>Var'aq is a Klingon programming language intended to embody the Klingon hacker ethic.  [Brian Connors]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_viku.htm">Viku</a></dt>
<dd>Only 10 phonemes (a, i, k, l, n, p, s, t, u, v).  Tropicalistic with grammar based on predicate logic.  Designed for writing poetry.  [Victor Medrano]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_voksigid.htm">Voksigid</a></dt>
<dd>"Voksigid was an attempt to construct a predicate language of a different type from those which had gone before. The first predicate language (Loglan,  developed by James Cooke Brown), and its descendant Lojban, developed by Robert LeChevalier, both used word order to mark the various places in the predication. I felt that remembering which position meant which role in the predication might be beyond easy memorization for most people. I assembled a development committee in 1991, and for several months we worked on the language, which we named Voksigid." - B.R. Gilson  [Bruce Gilson; et al]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_xapqt.htm">Xapqt</a></dt>
<dd>Claudio Gnoli writes, "A radical project of both a logical grammar and a logical vocabulary."  [Nick Summers]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_ystheron.htm">Ystheron</a></dt>
<dd>Richard Kennaway writes, "A logical language based upon the Polish notation of predicate logic."  [Patrick Littell]</dd>
