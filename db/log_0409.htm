I wrote a program to analyze the Esperanto words of the <a href=" https://www.travlang.com/Ergane/">Ergane dictionary</a> (which is public domain), parsing them into possible infix and affix series. So it would convert <i>frizistino</i>, "hairdresser", into <i>friz-ist-in-o</i>, which it translated into:<blockquote><b>tuurona</b> [< <i>tuw</i>, "hair-do" & -<i>ro</i>-, "professional" & -<i>na</i>-, "female".] n. Hairdresser, female hairdresser.</blockquote>Of course, it would also do crazy things like:<blockquote><b>machorab</b> [< <i>mab</i>, "beard" & -<i>cho</i>-, "collection" & -<i>ra</i>-, "doctrine".] n. Barbarism.</blockquote>Perhaps barbarism is a doctrine of collecting the beards of slain enemies?<br><br>These false analyses are a known problem with Esperanto's word formation, which is ambiguous.  The most famous example (from <a href="https://www.webcom.com/~donh/Esperanto/affixes.html">Don Harlow's site</a>) is <i>misiloj</i>, "missiles", which could be analyzed as <i>mis-il-o-j</i>, "tools that miss"!  My justification for these etymologies in the world of my language is listed at the top of <a href="/minhlex.htm">the lexicon</a>.<br><br>Basically this method of lexical derivation was something I had always wanted to try, but I knew it would take too long to correct the etymologies for an <a href="/db/eng_engelang.htm">engelang</a> (my usual field of conlanging).

The motto is a tribute to the Unknown Conlanger, described in Tolkien's essay, "A Secret Vice":<blockquote> I shall never forget a little man - smaller than myself - whose name I have forgotten, revealing himself by accident as a devotee, in a moment of extreme ennui, in a dirty wet marquee filled with trestle tables smelling of stale mutton fat, crowded with (mostly) depressed and wet creatures. We were listening to somebody lecturing on map-reading, or camp-hygiene, or the art of sticking a fellow through without (in defiance of Kipling) bothering who God sent the bill to; rather we were trying to avoid listening, though the Guards' English, and voice, is penetrating. The man next to me said suddenly in a dreamy voice: 'Yes, I think I shall express the accusative case by a prefix!' A memorable remark! Of course by repeating it I have let the cat, so carefully hidden, out of its bag, or at least revealed the whiskers. But we won't bother about that for a moment. Just consider the splendour of the words! 'I shall express the accusative case.' Magnificent! Not 'it is expressed', nor even the more shambling 'it is sometimes expressed', nor the grim 'you must learn how it is expressed'. What a pondering of alternatives within one's choice before the final decision in favour of the daring and unusual prefix, so personal, so attractive; the final solution of some element in a design that had hitherto proved refractory. Here were no base considerations of the 'practical', the easiest for the 'modern mind', or for the million - only a question of taste, a satisfaction of a personal pleasure, a private sense of fitness. As he said his words the little man's smile was full of a great delight, as of a poet or painter seeing suddenly the solution of a hitherto clumsy passage. Yet he proved as close as an oyster. I never gathered any further details of his secret grammar; and military arrangements soon separated us never to meet again (up to now at any rate). But I gathered that this queer creature -ever afterwards a little bashful after inadvertently revealing his secret - cheered and comforted himself in the tedium and squalors of 'training under canvas' by composing a language, a personal system and symphony that no else was to study or to hear. Whether he did this in his head (as only the great masters can), or on paper, I never knew. It is incidentally one of the attractions of this hobby that it needs so little apparatus! How far he ever proceeded in his composition, I never heard. Probably he was blown to bits in the very moment of deciding upon some ravishing method of indicating the subjunctive. Wars are not favourable to delicate pleasures.</blockquote></font></div><br><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#006699" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="OfSquirrelsPidgins"></a>Of Squirrels & Pidgins<small> - 9/16/04 - 10:38 am</small></font><div><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Skating Squirrel asks, "I was wondering what the easiest and most logical natural language and the easiest and most logical conlang to learn would be."<br><br>The easiest natlang would be a pidgin or creole; I would say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tok_Pisin">Tok Pisin</a> is probably one of the easiest to learn with the fewest irregularities (I take it by "most logical" you mean "most regular").  <br><br>Similarly, an easy conlang would be based on a pidgin.

I stumbled across your <a href=" https://ml0102.htm">A Naming Language</a>, which I found the most interesting and easy to deal with for a beginner, especially with the example at the end!  I would like to create a language with as much depth as possible, and the idea of starting off with basic roots from a proto-language (like Tolkien's etymologies in <i>The Lost Road</i>) seems brilliant. I understand how different languages develop different sounds, as [p] may over time change to a [b], etc., but I don't understand how languages can develop completely different grammars, such as Sindarin pluralizing by changing vowels, but Quenya adding an -i or -r to the end of the word, or how Latin and Greek have noun cases but English and French use separate prepositions."<br><br>As for Sindarin plurals, you can imagine that the Quenya plural suffix colored a preceding vowel (the articulation of which changed in anticipation of the suffix).  Gradually listeners mistook this part of the sound change as the marker for the plural, rather than the suffix, which was subsequently omitted.<br><br>As for the loss of cases, this can happen when prepositions begin to be used with nouns declined for case; eventually, the now-redundant case marking can be omitted with little loss of meaning.<br><br>For some other grammatical changes, consider:<ul><li>The evolution of Latin <i>ille</i> into definite articles in the Romance languages</li><li>The loss of irregular forms for infrequently used words (e.g., <i>kine</i> is the obsolete plural for <i>cow</i>; <i>brethren</i> for <i>brother</i>)</li><li>The fusion of postpositions with their preceding nouns giving rise to inflections.</li></ul>As the last example illustrates, grammatical changes can come full circle.</font></div><br><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#006699" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="FlagDaze"></a>Flag Daze<small> - 9/09/04 - 7:34 pm</small></font><div><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a href="/db/rsc_conlang.htm">CONLANG-L</a> is generating lots of ideas for flags to represent conlanging.  With so many good ideas, it's a bit overwhelming, but one of my favorites so far is by <a href="/db/mdl_index_languageauthor.htm#JanvanSteenbergen">Jan van Steenbergen</a>:<br><img src="/db/babelconlangflag.png" height="150">.<br><br>Here's my interpretation of this flag's symbolism:  The building of Babel represents the striving for new heights of creativity, which in the Babel story inadvertently resulted in the first splintering of human language.  The star compass can both represent the upward pull of the creative impulse and the fact that, in the story, after the fall of the Babel tower, humans were spread to the four corners of the world.<br><br>Of course, one man's religion is another man's mythology.  The Babel Text is actually a Jewish text (adopted by Christians) but used by non-Christian conlangers as a translation exercise because it is a mythological story of many languages from one.  The imagery reminds me vaguely of Tolkien, who often spoke of linguistic subcreation as the human imitation of divine creation.</font></div><br><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#006699" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="CheatCodes"></a>Cheat Codes<small> - 9/08/04 - 6:42 pm</small></font><div><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">C.F.

The only reason I feel a need to point this out is that I too have created ciphers, and I have created a conlang (<a href="/db/mdl_qatama.htm">Qatama</a>). There is such a large difference in the creative effort put forth that other conlangers who realize this might be offended by this being labeled a conlang."<br><br>A few video games pass ciphers off as conlangs.

I learned quite a bit about <a href="/db/mdl_kelen.htm">Kélen</a>, which Sylvia has been working on since circa 1982.  I was impressed at how much of the language she had at the tip of her tongue.  Kélen is a very well realized alien language, specifically designed to violate a human linguistic universal:  it has no verbs. We discussed Kélen's <a href="https://pw2.netcom.com/~sylvia1/Kelen/relationals.html">four relationals</a> (its alternative to verbs), which I suggested might actually each be different parts of speech, since you cannot replace one for the other (they have different affixing rules, among other things).  Sylvia also told me about <a href="https://pw2.netcom.com/~sylvia1/Kelen/intro.html#Kinship">Kélen kinship terms</a>, which were very interesting.<br><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005QDC9/"><img src="https://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00005QDC9.01._PE_SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg" align="right"></a>As I got into my car to leave, my CD queued up "Native Tongue" by <a href=" https://members.aol.com/autobeatnik/">The Mysteries of Life</a>.

You could blame irregularities on dialectal forms, though actually each dialect would have developed fairly regularly, if somewhat differently from the principal dialect.

It is a miniature<br>map of the city of Atlantis (i.e., the outside of the swirl is the cave, the inside shape is the silhouette of the city, and the dot is the location of the crystal).  It's a treasure map." - Kirk Wise</blockquote>It is the part inside the parentheses that I would like to get explained a little more.  Of course, it is because I have not seen the film that I do not understand.  Why would Atlantis be in a cave? (Except that it is sunken now...) To me, Atlantis is a country, rather then just a city. I imagine the city as rather similar to ancient Athens, but with a wall. What is so special about this crystal? Does it have any special powers, or...? Who is Kirk Wise?</blockquote>Atlantis isn't in a cave -- the treasure is in a cave, which is in the city of Atlantis, which is part of a submerged island.  The crystal is a phenomenal source of energy, and is a treasure to be found.  Kirk Wise is the director of <a href="https://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hc&id=1800263868&cf=gen&intl=us"><i>Atlantis: The Lost Empire</i> and other Disney movies</a>.</font></div><br><div><a href="log_0408.htm">Prior Month's Entries</a></div>
