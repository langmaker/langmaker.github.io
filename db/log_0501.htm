We list 172 auxlangs, 13.3% of the 1,295 conlangs we link to as I write this.  The fascination of making auxlangs, or international auxiliary languages, stems from the desire to create a language that people actually end up speaking and using.  I've made a few <a href="http:/db/eng_fauxlang.htm">fauxlangs</a> myself.  <br><br>If the adoption of an auxlang is a technical problem, then eventually an auxlang will emerge that is so easy to learn it rises up from the grassroots, much like Linux has done.  If the adoption of an auxlang is a political problem, then eventually an international body will select and popularize an auxlang.  Either way, I try to view auxlangs primarily as peculiar artistic creations.

I constantly receive lots of letters addressed to Mr. Jr or Jnr, and am frequently called out as Mr. Jr. (\djr\) or Mr. Mello Jr.; this seems to be an ethnocentric feature carried onto information systems (as in "the last string *has* to be the family name").

I must point out that it is an extremely common feature in Brazil (where the mother tongue is Portuguese) and, from what acquaintances tell me, of other countries in South America (all Spanish-speaking); the same seems to be the case in other non-English speaking countries. However, the American Roman numeral equivalent (II, III, etc.) never caught on (and is not allowed, anyway) in Brazil, though it is readily understood.<br><br>Interestingly, I have never been referred to as <i>Senhor Júnior</i> ("Mr. Jr.") in Brazil and other countries in South America, and anyone there can readily tell the family name.

If you've checked out my essay on <a href="/ml0102.htm">creating your first naming language</a> and <a href="https://www.zompist.com/kit.html">the Language Construction Kit</a> then you've seen the "getting started" guides.  I would suggest you dive in and start and go from there.  As for your specific questions:<ul><li>All you need to know about phonological constraints is that languages don't permit any sequence of sounds to be valid and your language should have its own syllable pattern:  CV, CVC, CCVC with a small group of CCs (e.g., /pl, kl, tl, pr, tr, kr/).  Feel free to use only sounds that occur in English, but do limit your possible syllables more than English does.</li><li>Orthography is just a fancy word for spelling.  Orthography can be as simple as using 'c' for /k/ or can be just pronouncing the words the way you spell them.</li><li>Diacritics are just those wacky things on letters;  I'm usually <a href="/db/eng_diacritical.htm">diacritical</a> and rarely use them myself.</li></ul>A useful language doesn't have to take forever to create.  You are aiming for verisimilitude, not reality;  an illusion of a language, rather than a whole language.  Try settling for a naming language for now.  Here's two examples of how straightforward such a language can be:  <a href="/durdekors.htm">Durdekors</a> and <a href="/kordron.htm">Kordron</a>.<br><br>If you're not having fun, you're doing it wrong. :-)</font></div><br><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#006699" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="TraceOn"></a>Trace On<small> - 1/08/05 - 10:29 pm</small></font><div><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">I watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084827/">Tron</a> the other day with my kids.
