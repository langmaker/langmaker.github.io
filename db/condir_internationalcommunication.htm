<dd>353 is a graphic and numeric language based on the idea that the numbers as much as the drawings are universal. Is it possible to speak with numbers or drawings? It is possible to communicate with colors, expressions, sounds? Could we talk enumerating in our maternal languages? And code everything of agreement that men and children can learn easily?

<dt><a href="mdl_advancedenglish.htm">Advanced English</a></dt>
<dd>Advanced English is an English spelling reform which makes English completely phonetic. Current spelling often is a nightmare for native and non-native speakers alike. In the UK, there are about 7 million people with poor spellings skills with at best first grader <i>niveau</i>. In the US, the estimated amount is even about 44 million which have poor spelling skills!  With a completely phonetic spelling, not only these numbers would be greatly reduced, but also it would be a great deal easier to learn English!  Unlike many other reform attempts, Advanced English doesn't make up some awkward far-fetched spellings, but rather stays close to the actual, official IPA pronunciations.  [Pascal A. Kramm]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_aercant.htm">Aercant</a></dt>

<dt><a href="mdl_afrihili.htm">Afrihili</a></dt>
<dd>Attobrah designed Afrihili to be an auxiliary language for the continent of Africa, with a phonology, vocabulary and grammar all derived from African languages.

<dd>This is a simplification of American English, with phonetic spelling and simplified grammar. Plurals of nouns and pronouns are regular (e.g., man, mans), comparison of adjectives and adverbs is regular (e.g., good, gooder, goodest), adjectives are formed from nouns by adding -i (e.g., sun, suni; America, Americai) and verbs are regular.

<dd>Basic English (Basic is an acronym for "British American Scientific International Commercial") was designed as a subset of English. Any Basic English text is also a valid English text, but Basic English has just 850 core words (not counting inflectional forms); extensions to the lexicon are permitted for specific subject domains. The Bible and other texts have been translated into Basic English. For a time, Ogden hoped Basic English would be used for teaching English as a second language, but because Basic English permits the full complexity of English grammar, this was not practical.  [C.

<dt><a href="mdl_bonjang.htm">Bonjang</a></dt>
<dd>Bonjang is a language that evokes images of bamboo groves, misty mountain escarpments, and ancient temples. It is the language of the magical halflings of the Eastern Isles. It is a highly regular language with elegant simplicity.  [Victor Medrano]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_brandonian.htm">Brandonian</a></dt>
<dd>Brandonian gender is determined differently than in most other Romance languages: nouns ending in a consonant or O are masculine, and ones ending in A or E are feminine. Most masculine nouns end in a consonant, except when it would be impossible to pronounce the word, so an O is added. In the same fashion, most feminine nouns end in a double letter plus an E, except for when pronunciation is impossible. Perhaps the most unique aspect of Brandonian is that double letters followed by an E, found in feminine words, are pronounced differently than their singular counterparts.  [Jordan Kay]</dd>

<dd>It uses a ton of lenition and uses modified English-esque grammar.  [Eric Anger]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_celltiecc.htm">Celltiecc</a></dt>
<dd>Celltiecc is, to date, the only truly Celtic auxiliary language. While Brithenig and Breathanach imagine a language that would have occurred had Latin displaced Celtic languages, Celltiecc is actually a lingua franca for Celtic speakers, not Romance-based.  Site #1 is actually quite out-of-date and is about 120 words short (the lexicon has about 250 words). For more updated information, go to the Celltiecc mailing list at Site #2. Created in 1998 but revived in 2003 and still in the works, so any estimate of dictionary size will be out-of-date soon. Well about 250, I think.  [Duke Keenan; Nathaniel Ament-Stone; Dean Powell]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_ceqli.htm">Ceqli</a></dt>
<dd>Rex F. May writes, "Since it was originally intended as a replacement for Loglan, Ceqli (cheng-li) began as a logical language. However, the goals of the language have changed since then. It has abandoned being completely unambiguous; instead it seeks to provide the option of being unambiguous in most cases, while allowing very concise ambiguous forms. Seeing how concise these forms can get has been a focus of the language lately, leading to the criticism that it is a 'language of newspaper headlines'. Its grammar has also changed from the predicate-based structure of Loglan, where any predicate can be a noun, verb, or modifier, based on its position in the sentence, to one more based on natural languages, which distinguishes nouns and verbs."  [Rex F. May]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_choton.htm">Choton</a></dt>
<dd>Now this isn't your run-of-the-mill romance auxlang (which has been done to death already), but rather it is based upon English (as the most used natural language for international communication), German (as the second-most important Germanic language) and Japanese (since East-Asian languages are generally completely ignored by auxlangs, with Japanese being the most important there, and also the most suited one). Along with this go a very simple and quick to grasp grammar and a completely phonetic spelling, without going overboard by the abounding use of unusual special characters - only two of them (instead of 7 as in Esperanto) for which a very simple alternative is presented. An optional unique script is also present.  [Pascal A. Kramm]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_globish.htm">Globish</a></dt>
<dd>One of two languages with this name, Globish is Parallel English with neat spelling. Globish uses small letters (no capitals) with triple dot (...) to end a sentence. All words are spelled per sound, according to standard symbol-sound relations (tentative scheme offered). This is no attempt to change spellings within current English. That is unpractical. But a parallel language can work. Capitals are used to start words (such as names) if respelling is not acceptable due to any reason.  English language has many merits but its spellings are illogical and difficult. It is not feasible to reform spellings in current English. But it is feasible to use Globish, with neat spellings, as a parallel language. Globish is written in a slightly different Roman script, which is available on all machines. India is world's largest user of English language, next to USA, UK. Several Indians like the concept of Globish. Moreover, there is no antagonism towards English language in India, as is the case with some European countries. India is growing in world influence. So Globish (as per Indian perception) has potential to grow. Globish would be a full-fedged language with literature, dictionaries etc. eventually when the idea becomes popular worldwide. Surely the intelligent human race deserves a logical linked language. Name Globish, symbol-sound relations are tentative. Things would eveolve with time.  [Madhukar Gogate]</dd>

<dd>"One of the pamphlets I got was ... was the <i>Standard-Grammar of the Auxiliary Language Intal</i> by Erich Weferling. It was written entirely in Intal, yet I read it painlessly. It had the regularity of Ido (or Esperanto) but was as at-sight-readable as Interlingua. I really felt that this was the ideal IAL. It had a few idiosyncrasies like an Esperantine 'kv' in words that ought to have 'qu' and the 'c' being pronounced 'sh,' but these were quite minor to me. Intal became the language I pushed. And in fact I would still be a devotee of Intal if I had not found, in a used book store, Jespersen's book <i>An International Language</i>, where he defined Novial. I found that everything I liked about Intal had been anticipated by Jespersen, and so it is now Novial that I now favor." - <a href="https://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/3141/langpage.html">Bruce Gilson</a>  [Erich Weferling]</dd>

<dd>Peano felt that - while the Latin vocabulary is known to many people through its descendant languages and scientific borrowings - its inflexional system and syntax were too complex. By stripping Latin of its "ponderous burden of inflexions", Peano hoped to design the ideal auxiliary language. Latino Sine Flexione's vocabulary consists of all Latin words (including Latin borrowings of Greek terms) and the growing collection of common "international" words. Peano originally called the language Latino sine Flexione ("Latin without inflections") then changed the name to Interlingua. Since the IALA's Interlingua is now more well known, Peano's language is usually referred to by its original name.  [Giuseppe Peano]</dd>

I chose not to try a unique script quite yet, thinking that would be a bit too complex at this point (especially considering the fact that I have no means whatsoever to create a typeface, and plain images are too clumsy). Essentially, it is an effort to create a relatively simple language, possibly for the purpose of being an international language such as Esperanto or Ido.  [Andrew J. Meilstrup]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_lone.htm">Lone</a></dt>
<dd>Lone is an isolating language that has a pan-European vocabulary. Thus it combines, among others, words from Romance, Slavic and Germanic languages (in order of importance).  Lone (pronounced something like lawnay or loné) is a simple constructed language that is still under construction. Lone's purpose is to be a new kind of Euroclone combining vocabulary from languages all around the Europe. (Considering the special nature of Lone's words it is quite probably that some words must be drawn from languages outside the Europe.)  Lone briefly 1.&#9;Every word is read as it is written. The accent falls always on the first syllable. 2.&#9;The syntax: subject, predicate, object. 3.&#9;The nouns appear only in one form. There isn't singular or plural. The amount is defined with numerals or adjectives. 4.&#9;Simple qualifiers precede the word that they qualify. Prepositional qualifiers follow it. 5.&#9;In combined words the qualifier precedes the main word. 6.&#9;Adjectives and adverbs are similar. The comparison is conducted with the help of particles. 7.&#9;The verbs are not inflected. Tense (aspect) and modus are formed with the help of particles. 8.&#9;The syntax can be altered, if it doesn't affect the meaning of the sentence.  Lone step by step 1.a) Every word is read as it is written. Lone's writing is phonetic. In other words every word is read as it is written and every word is written as it is said. Thus knowing the sounds of the letters enables to read and write Lone. The concept is naive but it is also smart and ideal. a&#9;a&#9;i&#9;i&#9;r&#9;r b&#9;b&#9;j&#9;?&#9;s&#9;s c&#9;?&#9;k&#9;k?&#9;t&#9;t? d&#9;d&#9;l&#9;l&#9;u&#9;u e&#9;e&#9;m&#9;m&#9;v&#9;v f&#9;f&#9;n&#9;n&#9;z&#9;z g&#9;g&#9;o&#9;o&#9;&#9; h&#9;h&#9;p&#9;p?&#9;&#9;  Most of the consonants are similar to their common English sounds with the following exceptions: c is pronounced as sh in ship. j is pronounced as s in measure. r is trilled as in Spanish and Russian. Also the French and the German r sounds will do. Using the English r is strongly discouraged. 1.b) The accent falls on the first syllable. 2. The syntax: subject, predicate, object.  The main syntax is the same as in English. Note that it doesn't change in question. tora tiger rata rat case chase tora case rata. The tiger chases the rat. rata case tora. The rat chases the tiger.   3. The nouns have united singular and plural form In Lone there is no singular nor plural form of the noun. Instead the number (as well as the quantity) is indicated by other words, such as numerals and adjectives, that precede the qualified noun. tora tiger unu tora a tiger, one tiger mega tora million tigers boku tora a lot of tigers suna sand zero suna no sand at all boku suna a lot of sand  4.a) Simple qualifiers precede the word that they qualify. Adjectives preced the noun that they qualify. joli pretty nove new siti city joli siti pretty city nove siti new city nove joli siti new pretty city  Adverbs precede the verb that they qualify. nataca Natasha (a person's name) joli pretty rede talk joli nataca rede. Pretty Natasha talks. nataca joli rede. Natasha talks prettily. joli nataca joli rede. Pretty Natasha talks prettily.   4. b) Prepositional qualifiers follow the word that they qualify. siti city dona lady rusia Russia siti na rusia a Russian city (a city in Russia) dona de rusia a Russian lady (a lady from Russia)  5. In combined words the qualifier precedes the main word. Lone's combined words are ideally similar to those of English. In Lone they are attached together with a middle dot (·). mare sea riba fish mare·riba seafish, fish of the sea  6.a) Adjectives and adverbs are similar. As earlier stated, the adjectives and adverbs precede the word that they qualify. sugo vida a spectacular life dona sugo vida. A lady lives spectacularly. A lady leads a spectacular life.  The prepositional qualifiers follow the word that they qualify. note be repo a night without rest, a restless night saca rabota be repo. Sasha works without rest.   7. Verbs are not inflected. Verbs do not indicate tense nor aspect. The tense is indicated by the following particles. ge the past nu the present va the future nataca ge rede. Natasha talked (in the past). nataca nu rede. Natasha talks (at the moment). nataca va rede. Natasha will talk (in the future).    © 2002 Risto Kupsala, rkupsala@tols17.oulu.fi  [Risto Kupsala]</dd>

<dd>Lexicon derived from a diverity of languages, simple mostly isolating grammar. Small phonemic inventory with a generous set of allophones for easy pronunciation.  [Dana Nutter]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_senesepera.htm">Sen:esepera</a></dt>
<dd>I designed Sen:esepera to reform Esperanto to make it easier to pronounce. Where Esperanto has 23 consonants, Sen:esepera has only the 14 most commonly used consonants; where Esperanto permits complex consonant clusters (e.g., spr), Sen:esepera only permits clusters using nasals. Sen:esepera is also noteworthy for its kinship terms, capable of concisely expressing thousands of familial relationships.  [Jeffrey Henning]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_sermo.htm">Sermo</a></dt>
<dd>Sermo can be understood without study by almost all speakers of Romance languages. It can be used to immediately communicate; Sermo is a simple and phonetic language.  [Jose Soares Da Silva]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_signuno.htm">Signuno</a></dt>
<dd>Signuno is a method to sign regular Esperanto; it aims to strengthen Esperanto's position as a candidate IAL.</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_silarg.htm">Silarg</a></dt>
<dd>Argtxep: "The Concept of the Citadel".  With Silarg, an artificial language for the lesbians & gay.  Why?  Not "to isolate us" a little more, some would say.  Instead, for example, foreigners could communicate in spite of their linguistic differences, anywhere.  [JP Mallaroni]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_simpekso.htm">Simpekso</a></dt>
<dd>Verb tense indicators, common descriptors to both verbs and adverbs, strict setence order, few dipthongs, and unambiguous pronunciation. Simpekso  is completely phonetic.  [Jonathon Grimes]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_simpenga.htm">Simpenga</a></dt>
<dd>Simpenga, pronounced /sim-PEN-ga/, is a contraction of Simpela Engelisa, "Simple English." The language is just a phonetically simpler version of Basic English. Yawn.  [Jeffrey Henning]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_simpla.htm">Simpla</a></dt>
<dd>It is a language that is simple like Esperanto but easier for English-speaking peoples.  Note: This Language has been discontinued. Sorry :(  [Samuel Fredrickson]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_slovio.htm">SLOVIO</a></dt>
<dd>This language is unique in the fact that it is understood without learning by around 400 million speakers of Slavic languages. It has a simplified grammar and spelling and one can read and write it on just about any computer of the world. It uses the basic English alphabet without any additional letters, accents or signs to express all the usual sounds common for Slavic languages. Its simple spelling, pronunciation and grammar make this language easy to learn by all speakers of all languages. And because it is based on the largest European language group, on closely related languages, it can be understood without learning by a millions of people and thus, unlike most constructed languages, it has a natural base of millions of speakers.  [Mark Hucko]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_solresol.htm">Solresol</a></dt>
<dd>The cleverest philosophical language, the earliest constructed language to be successful and the most likely to be learned by Julie Andrews. Solresol is based on the musical scale and has just seven syllables: do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si.  [Jean Francois Sudre]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_speedtalk.htm">Speedtalk</a></dt>
<dd>In his science-fiction story Gulf, supermen of the future used a language called Speedtalk. This "verbal shorthand" assigned every word a unique phoneme, so that resultant sentences were as short as a few English words. Use of the language enabled the superman to think more quickly and to experience more in less time.  [Robert A. Heinlein]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_spet.htm">Spet</a></dt>
<dd>Spet is a reconstructed language inspired by Genesis 11 and can be known as the Proto-World Language.  Here is the first sentence of the Lord's Prayer in Spet: Baba na mes sen tim kan el nine shengd@ (think of Papa <of> me <in> <heaven> and the name saint>)  [ACZ]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_suma.htm">Suma</a></dt>
<dd>Suma is an a priori language, but is unusual for the category in that its vocabulary does not use a systematic classification system. The language allows only CV (consonant+vowel) syllables, for easy-to-pronounce words.  [Barnett Russell]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_thequm.htm">Thequm</a></dt>
<dd>The language can be learned very easy by anyone. The pronunciation is not difficult.  [Sami Kleit]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_tikasako.htm">Tikasako</a></dt>
<dd>We were stuck at home for a snowday January 5, 2002, so I made this little language in half an hour as a joke.  The thing is, some of my friends thought it was a good idea.  Hmm.  [Chris Paull (Zeke Fordsmender)]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_tinico.htm">tinico</a></dt>
<dd>It has open code; everybody can freely change it. The language started from the speech, and only later it was written. Therefore, the orthography is purely phonetic (basic Latin alphabet, without special marks neither accented letters).  [Collective]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_tomato.htm">Tomato</a></dt>
<dd>The author writes, "[Tomato] can bring peace to the world and harmony to the soul as well as food to the stomach if not money to the purse. It still doesn't mean anything as a word within itself (TO-MATO = ??-COAT) but is saucy and euphonic. At the trailing edge of linguistic genetic evolution, after millions of minute prunings tramplings and debuggings, at last we have prepared for you these..."  [Catty]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_transitionalenglish.htm">Transitional English</a></dt>
<dd>It is the only complete simplification, grammatical and lexical, of English -- the most widely spoken natural language, entailing phonetic spelling, simplified morphology, syntax, and lexicon in order to facilitate the quickest, easiest, and most economical acquisition of the language by speakers of other languages.  [Prof. John Lihani, Ph.D.]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_tutonish.htm">Tutonish</a></dt>
<dd>Molee designed Tutonish as an "Anglo-German union tongue" and actually intended for it to be not just an international auxiliary language but the new mother tongue of the Germanic-speaking peoples, supplanting their native languages. Tutonish has a phonetic spelling, a simplified grammar and a vocabulary drawn primarily from German and English. (See Folkspraak for a modern, ongoing effort at designing a pan-Germanic language.)  [Elias Molee]</dd>

<dd>A new international language that is based on 16 different languages.  [The site is in Chinese, English, Japanese and Korean.]  [Language Research Institute, Sejong University]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_unitario.htm">Unitario</a></dt>
<dd>A Euroclone with a vocabulary based extensively on Spanish. Contrast with Eurolengo.  [M. Pleyer]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_universal.htm">Universal</a></dt>
<dd>The most characteristic feature of Universal is its use of inversion to create antonyms: mega `big, great' -> gema `small' donu `give' -> nodu `receive'  za `the' -> az `a(n)' tela `far, distant' -> leta `near, close'   Indeed, this is so characteristic that "one of its creators suggested in jest that it should be called Inversal".  [G. I. Muravkin and L. I. Vasilevskij]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_universalglot.htm">Universalglot</a></dt>
<dd>Universalglot, proposed in 1868 by Jean Pirro (1831-1886), a teacher in Lotharingen, seemed one of the most natural and agreeable: <i>Ma senior! I sende evos un gramatik e un verb-bibel de un nuov glot nomed universal glot. In futur I scripterai evos semper in dit glot.</i> However, this quite well designed project did not achieve any practical importance. --  Ulrich Matthias  [Jean Pirro]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_uusisuom.htm">Uusisuom</a></dt>
<dd>An IAL based on Finnish, but with the irregularities and complications removed and certain non-Finnish features added. Vocabulary seems to be largely Finnish to my inexpert eyes. A non-IE Euroclone, perhaps.  [Daniel Tammet]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_vinlandic.htm">Vinlandic</a></dt>
<dd>It is intended to give English speakers an introductory course in learning Germanic (primarily Scandinavian) languages. The grammar is  primarily based on that of English, however there are some differences. The  purpose of this is to help learners get the idea of a foreign language  without completely overwhelming them right away.  [Tony Senn]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_vling.htm">Vling</a></dt>
<dd>Vling, inspired by Oriental xenophilia, uses the magic of tones to differentiate the parts of speech.  By merely changing the tone, a word can be converted from a noun to a verb to an adjective to an adverb, et cetera.  While 3000 words have been coined, not all have been defined yet.  [Victor Medrano]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_voaspecialenglish.htm">VOA Special English</a></dt>
<dd>The Voice Of America has daily broadcasts in Special English, a simplified English created at the height of the Cold War by the United States Information Agency to provide a more accessible English.  News reports written in Special English use a limited wordlist of 1500 words, with simpler sentences spoken slower than regular English.  [United States Information Agency]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_volapuk.htm">Volapük</a></dt>
<dd>With a name meaning "world speech", Volapük became something of a fad in the late nineteenth century and was the second international auxiliary language to win thousands of adherents (after Solresol); it was the precursor to Esperanto in popularity. It has a vocabulary based primarily on English and German roots that have been somewhat simplified for ease of pronunciation and morphological analysis. Its grammar was difficult enough that enthusiasts were rarely able to actually learn to speak the language. The language was successfully reformed in the 1930s. If Esperanto is the GUI (Graphical User Interface) of auxiliary languages, than Volapük is the DOS of the field. The language is primarily of interest now for historical reasons.

<dt><a href="mdl_vorlin.htm">Vorlin</a></dt>
<dd>Harrison is approaching the design of Vorlin very professionally, and you can read his opinions about the requirements of an international language in an excellent essay on his web site. Harrison is the editor of the Journal Of Planned Languages and has prepared a detailed bibliography of constructed languages. He is arguably the foremost scholar of constructed languages working on the Internet today. Vorlin is most noted for its use of words with three letters for its base vocabulary. The language has changed significantly over the years and still has far to go, as Harrison restructures its vocabulary. This site is worth checking out periodically.  [Rick Harrison]</dd>
