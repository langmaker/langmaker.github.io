<dt><a href="mdl_adare.htm">Adare</a></dt>
<dd>It has been made as the wisest tongue in its world, a language of the High Culture of Northern Vissar, a language commonly used for literature and spiritual beliefs, magic and so on. It is developed on the basis of the common parts of Finnish, Basque, Japanese, Latin and Quenya, but being a complete homogeneous language, with its own caracteristics in syntax,declension, phonetics and vocabulary.  [Asier G.]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_ahlimite.htm">Ahlimite</a></dt>
<dd>[John Whatmough]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_alarian.htm">Alarian</a></dt>
<dd>Like a few other real world languages, some of its word forms come from a description of an object rather than an object having a name.  Such as "hand" is written has "body gives" or "body writes".  The language is also very rhythmic.  [Noby Nobriga]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_alphistian.htm">Alphistian</a></dt>
<dd>[Tony Skags]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_ambarnic.htm">Ambarnic</a></dt>
<dd>Ambarnic has a unique system of vowel ablaut that is utilized in forming noun plurals and verb tenses.  It also uses frequent palatalization.  [Jordan Lavender]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_ammaniar.htm">Amman-Iar</a></dt>
<dd>If you have ever longed to see one of Tolkien's languages brought to completion, you will love Amman-Iar, created in the spirit of Sindarin and Quenya and set in a new continent of Middle Earth. Originally inspired by Elvish, Amman-Iar has grown into something quite different, with a unique flavor of its own and a richly realized grammar. Amman-Iar is one of the few constructed languages on the Web with a detailed fictional history of word derivation.  [David Bell]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_archeia.htm">Archeía</a></dt>
<dd>It's a richly inflected language and maybe the conlang with the most irregular verbs (ca. 35). It also has a rich set of derivational affixes. With a few borrowings, it might even be turned into a working modern language. One other uniqueness is that several Greek letters are used.  [Anselm Huppenbauer]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_arkian.htm">Arkian</a></dt>
<dd>Arkian is the official language of the micro-community Ark. Besides its unique set of source languages (pick another constructed language with words drawn primarily from Turkish, Finnish, Chinese and Czech!), Arkian has a unique script and unique grammatical features like indefinite animate gender and frame clause construction. Unfortunately for English speakers, the 1500-word Arkian dictionary is in Czech.  [Jan Havlis]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_aronian.htm">Aronian</a></dt>
<dd>Aronian is unique for several reasons. It has a complex case system with about fifteen cases, much like Finnish. Another peculiarity with relation to the Uralic family is that it inflects its verbs for 13 moods, many moods which eliminate the function of certain verbs in English. Its verb system is split up into four different groups which each have different methods of inflection: transitive, intransitive, bitransitive, and reflexive. The verbs do not inflect for tense, however there are separate auxiliary verbs used for tense. There is only one irregular verb - the pro-verb, which functions in much the same way as the English pro-verb: to do. What really makes the language unique is its verb system. It has three numbers - singular, dual, and plural, and even more unique is that it has four persons, the fourth being hypothetical along with other uses.  [Dillon Shaw]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_arvorec.htm">Arvorec</a></dt>
<dd>Arvorec is (in Ill Bethisad) virtually unique, the only surviving P-Celtic language.  [Deiniol Jones]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_ashaille.htm">Asha'ille</a></dt>
<dd>[Arthaey Angosii]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_atlanatlantean.htm">Atlan (Atlantean)</a></dt>
<dd>Atlan ("Atlantean" in English) is one of the languages spoken in the Atlantean Empire, supposedly discovered in an alternate world. The history of the Empire is told in great detail, along with most of its languages. Atlan is one of four descendants of the Juralic group of languages, and its historical development, grammar and vocabulary are all described, and more is being added all the time.  [Graham Mabey]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_awingiwa.htm">aw'ingiwa</a></dt>
<dd>A descendent of kingiwa 'awiwasa, and a second-generation descendent of kingifa, aw'ingiwa has a much more complex verb  morphology, and three noun classes - obligatorily possessed, inalienably possessed and alienably possessed.  [Apollo Hogan]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_axunashin.htm">Axunashin</a></dt>
<dd>Axunashin may have the most elaborately developed syntax of any artlang, with the syntax represented as a series of transformations. Axunashin is the language of Axunai, the ancient empire of southern Ereláe in Verduria.  It is the ancestor of Xurnás and Teôshi; it is related to related Cadinor and Cuêzi.  Wede:i, Jeori, Old Skourene, Tzhuro and Mei have all influenced Axunashin.  Proto-Eastern's nominative and accusative noun declension has, in Axunashin, evolved into a unique system of honorifics.  [Mark Rosenfelder]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_barakhinei.htm">Barakhinei</a></dt>
<dd>Barakhinei is a sister language of Verdurian, spoken in the mountain lands of Barakhún, Mútkün, and Hroth. Verdurians think it sounds harsh and primitive... of course, the Barakhinei consider the Verdurians to be spineless degenerates. Barakhinei has its own alphabet, and perhaps its most notable feature is the important sex differences: in effect, there are separate male and female dialects.  [Mark Rosenfelder]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_breathanach.htm">Breathanach</a></dt>
<dd>Breathanach is the first constructed language inspired by Q-Celtic on the Web. It is the "Q" to Brithenig's "P": what might have happened if Latin had been filtered through a Gaelic phonology. The site features a grammar and sample texts.  [Geoff Eddy]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_brithenig.htm">Brithenig</a></dt>
<dd>One of the best of the fictional languages on the web. Brithenig is the language of an alternate history, being the Romance language that might have evolved if Latin speakers had displaced Celtic speakers in Britain. Brithenig has undergone sound changes similar to those of Welsh, and has borrowed from Old Celtic and from Old, Middle and Modern English.  [Andrew Smith]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_cadhinor.htm">Cadhinor</a></dt>
<dd>Cadhinor is the ancestor languages of many of Mark's other languages, including <a href="/db/mdl_barakhinei.htm">Barakhinei</a>, <a href="/db/mdl_ismain.htm">Ismain</a> and <a href="/db/mdl_verdurian.htm">Verdurian</a>.  Cadhinor is itself descended from <a href="/db/mdl_protoeastern.htm">Proto-Eastern</a>.   The grammar is written as if it were a native grammar of the language: "I've decided to post a translation of <i>Pere aluatas i Cadhinor</i>, by the Verdurian scholar Shm Fatandor Revouse, published in 3417, and intended for <i>avisar</i> (secondary school) students. It should not be taken as the best Verdurians can do; that would be the scholarly, three-volume <i>Aluatas Shriftanáei Cadhinei</i> (University Grammar of Cadhinor). I've chosen Revouse because it's popular and typical of Verdurian attitudes toward languages-- it's like a Verdurian <i>Teach Yourself</i>."  [Mark Rosenfelder]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_chovur.htm">Chovur</a></dt>
<dd>Chovur is the ancestral tongue of a group of nomads living in the northern steppes of a fictional world.  [J. Fatula]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_coeniathen.htm">Coeniathen</a></dt>
<dd>Coeniathen is designed to be slightly Celtic-like. Some distinct features are the "Darkening" of all short vowels (e.g. [a] > [O], [o] > [U] 'w'), the "Vowel-Breaking" after former aspirates and the oblique case that covers genitive and accusative.  [Anselm Huppenbauer]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_danarib.htm">Danarib</a></dt>
<dd>Danarib is a language designed with a deliberate emphasis on euphony and alliteration.  It uses prefixes to designate noun, pronoun and adjective declensions, while suffixes are used to conjugate verbs and adverbs.  Words come from a basic root which can be modified to form any part of speech.  [Gary Wann]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_demonicalorian.htm">Demonic/Alorian</a></dt>
<dd>I abused one major universal. I have eight vowels, <b>all</b> back vowels, and all with '_e' (pharyngealized) to make them sound angry. The language has seven aspects, 28 cases and 24 moods, and so is inflectional to the extreme! My 'odd' gender system, and my "purposeful" choice of consonants to make the language harsh and ugly makes Black Speech sound like Finnish ;).  [Kevin Urbanczyk]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_dermensin.htm">Dermensin</a></dt>
<dd>Dermensin (De*rmënsin) is a language that sounds primitive but that is very complex and developed. It's a language that is used for literature and scientific books in my conworld. Its uniqueness is the euphonic use of /k/. The six types of accents are really good too.  [Eugenio M. Vigo]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_dhapatu.htm">Dha-Patu</a></dt>
<dd>Dha-Patu is completely analytical; it has only two parts of speech, radicals and particles; it has sets of particles that form noun and verb phrases, classify the nouns and define the functions of the verbs; it has an artificial core vocabulary, expanded by loans from natural languages (mainly Greek and Latin). The grammar was conceived entirely on a priori logical principles, and the core vocabulary was generated by random combinations of the given letters. The site features a dictionary of over 1,250 words, a grammar and sample texts.  [Karl Jahn]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_diudisk.htm">Diudisk</a></dt>
<dd>It's morphologically simple like English, lexically Germanic and phonetically really easy.  [Raginvard Flut]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_doriathrin.htm">Doriathrin</a></dt>
<dd>The native tongue of Lúthien Tinúviel, the elf-maid who loved a mortal. Possible dialect of Ilkorin.  [J.R.R. Tolkien]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_draconic2.htm">Draconic</a></dt>
<dd>This is the language used by only Dragons and beings with dragon lineage, and a handful of those who the dragon felt deserving of its knowledge.  A great many magic spells were based on this most ancient language.  No language even remotely resembles its structure, as only the most powerful of beings who speak it.  [Bryant]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_edashul.htm">E Dashul</a></dt>
<dd>VSO word order, a combined particle-article system of organization, cursive script, simple usage of lax/tense vowels for word functionality.  [Anthony Raymond Bullard]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_eastern.htm">Eastern</a></dt>
<dd>A cousin to Watakassí, Eastern is phonetically far more complex, with more phonemes and more complex syllables.  It also has less agglutination, and more isolation and fusion, using auxillary verbs to replace several inflections of Watakassí and its ancestor, and using prepositions to replace some of the cases.  [Nik Taylor]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_egren.htm">Egren</a></dt>
<dd>Egren, or the Common Fantasy Tongue, is one of my best projects with computer-generated lexicon (it works!).  The grammar is rather Indo-European, and I'm intending to evolve some other languages from this one.  [Tuomo Sipola]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_elatoi.htm">Elatoi</a></dt>
<dd>[John Whatmough]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_elkaril.htm">Elkaril</a></dt>
<dd><img src="https://www.zompist.com/illo/elksuf3.gif" align="left">"Each CVC syllable in Elkarîl is drawn in the form of a face-- taking advantage of the hominid brain's ability to perceive faces quickly and easily as a gestalt."  "Elkarîl is the language of the elcari... It is the best-known non-human language of Ereláe... <i>elkar</i> is literally `the making people'. I write <i>elcar</i>, plural <i>elcari</i>, because this is the form of the word in Verdurian. I avoid the translation `dwarf' since it imports too many associations from terrestrial legends."  [Mark Rosenfelder]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_elvish.htm">Elvish</a></dt>
<dd>Elvish is the common term for the family of languages created by J.R.R. Tolkien in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> and other works.  The movies and books primarily feature <a href="/db/mdl_quenya.htm">Quenya</a> and <a href="/db/mdl_sindarin.htm">Sindarin</a>.    Other Elvish languages include <a href="/db/mdl_avarin.htm">Avarin</a>, <a href="/db/mdl_doriathrin.htm">Doriathrin</a>, <a href="/db/mdl_ilkorin.htm">Ilkorin</a>, <a href="/db/mdl_nandorin.htm">Nandorin</a>, <a href="/db/mdl_primitiveelvish.htm">Primitive Elvish</a>, <a href="/db/mdl_qenya.htm">Qenya</a> (precursor to Quenya), <a href="/db/mdl_telerin.htm">Telerin</a> and <a href="/db/mdl_valarin.htm">Valarin</a>.  [J.R.R. Tolkien]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_emterz.htm">Emterz</a></dt>
<dd>Emterz is a language which is a version of Emterezka which is simpler. Unlike English, Emterz uses 7 vowels: AE, A, E, I, O, U, and ('[a sound like UH]). When some consonants are next to another (H, L, R, W, and Y), they form a vowel sound.  [Edgar c.]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_fergiartisch.htm">Fergiartisch</a></dt>
<dd>High developed grammar. It does not only list sounds and forms, but also usages, syntax, etc.  [Johannes Hufnagel]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_flestrin.htm">Flestrin</a></dt>
<dd>[What's unique about Flestrin?] Of course its story and ambient world.  (Warning) The site is only in Italian, and will be completed when it will be incorporated with the site of the language's surrounding world.  [Maurizio Rovatti]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_forendar.htm">Forendar</a></dt>
<dd>David Bell writes, "Forendar is descended from the same protolanguage (Vulanayal) as Amman Iar.  Forendar will be basically agglutinative like Amman Iar, but unlike Amman Iar almost exclusively suffixing. The unmarked word order will continue to be SV/AOV, but considerable deviation will be possible in forendar. There will be clearly defined classes of noun, adjective, locational and temporal qualifiers, speech-act pronouns, deictic, verb, adverb, particle and interjection. Definite deictics which also will have some of the functions of 3rd person pronouns, will not vary for number but will involve a 3-term spatial system, proximal, distal and indefinite."

<dd>The Hattic language (zõjuk Chader) constitutes a separate branch of the Indo-European family. It can be classified as a kentum language, somewhere between Tocharian and the Germanic languages. Both vocabulary and grammar are systematically derived from PIE roots according to fixed phonological rules. Characteristic is the frequent use of nasal vowels and spirants.  (It should be noted that Hattic has nothing in common with the ancient, non-IE language of the same name, spoken in Anatolia long ago.)  Currently, Hattic has only one sister language, Askaic; this number, however, is likely to grow with the years.  [Jan van Steenbergen]</dd>

Extensive information about the people who speak the language should also be included. For now however, the tales that have arisen around the language have become more important than the language itself! So I'm not so sure about the immediate future of the true content of the web site.

<dd>Kebreni is the language of Kebri, which is near Verduria on the planet of Almea.  Its grammar is designed to differ from that of English in nearly every way possible: for instance, the verbal system depends on categories like aspect, politeness, desire, and volitional impact, and not at all on person, number, or tense, and conjugation depends on metathesis and vowel change rather than inflection.  Kebreni's ancestor language Methaiun is worked out as well, and Kebreni derives from it in a historically plausible way.

Until then, most details are subject to change (especially the exact forms of words).  The PDF will be updated regularly; right now, it ends abruptly and includes references to sections that have not been written yet.  I welcome comments and questions.

<dd>A few oddities, like having 17 cases (ideas from Finnish and Russian).

Another fun idea was Intensification and Comparisons of Degree.  As for my "Flip morpheme", this little gem takes an adjective and turns it into an adverb and vice versa: not in a standard way, mind you, since an adjective is still a noun, but I can now bury a noun phrase in a verb phrase, and say the whole sentence (word) is just a verb phrase  ... to get the full idea of these neat modifiers, you'll have to look and see :).

<dt><a href="mdl_verdurian.htm">Verdurian</a></dt>
<dd>Not only does it have a large vocabulary (over 5,500 words) and a linguistically informed grammar, Verdurian also has a fully worked-out family tree, going back two levels: to its ancestor, Cadhinor, and to its ultimate origin, Proto-Eastern, with sister languages at both levels.  It is naturalistic, with irregularities, sound changes, dialect differences, and interesting etymologies, giving it great appeal to others.  And it's only one part of a complex created world, with its own biology, history, and  belief systems.  [Mark Rosenfelder]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_vozgian.htm">Vozgian</a></dt>
<dd>Vozgian is my answer to the question: what would a fictional North-Slavonic language family have looked like? The result is a language derived directly from Common Slavic, but deeply influenced by the Uralic languages, notably Finnish and Komi (for example, it has no less than 12 cases).  Vozgian is the name-giving language of the (fictional) Vozgian Republic, a constituent of the Russian Federation in Ill Bethisad. It is written in Cyrillic script with a few modifications.  Along with two sister languages (Motyak and Slopik), Vozgian was started in 1996. However, the current version of the language has little in common with either of them; in fact, it was redone from scratch in 2003.  [Jan van Steenbergen]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_watakassi.htm">Watakassí</a></dt>
<dd>It is agglutinative, with a gender system, and a redundant pluralization pattern (in both the gender-prefix, and in a suffix on the noun).  It is verb initial, but otherwise has free word order, with many cases and a fairly elaborate system of aspects.  [Nik Taylor]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_wedei.htm">Wede:i</a></dt>
<dd>An ancient language of Almea (the world Verduria is on), Wede:i is agglutinative, with no strict division into parts of speech, meaning a single Wede:i word can express quite a lot of English verbiage.  Other unusual aspects, for a constructed language, include its logographic writing system and its base 6 number system.  Finally, it fits into the history of Almea; its writing system became that of Axunashin, a distant relative of Verdurian, when the speakers of Axunashin conquered the Xengi valley; their language was also influenced phonologically and lexically by Wede:i.  The lexicon lists over 600 words, with etymologies; a grammar, sample texts and description of the writing system are available.  [Mark Rosenfelder]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_wenedyk.htm">Wenedyk</a></dt>
<dd>Wenedyk (in English: Venedic) is a Slavo-Romance language. Officially, it is a descendent from Vulgar Latin with a strong Slavic admixture, based on the premise that the Roman Empire incorporated the ancestors of Poles in their territory. Unofficially, Wenedyk just tries to show what Polish would have looked like if it had been a Romance instead of a Slavic language.  Wenedyk is one of the languages of the Republic of the Two Crowns in Ill Bethisad, where it replaces Polish.  [Jan van Steenbergen]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_wessisc.htm">Wessisc</a></dt>
<dd>Wessisc, inspired by Brithenig, started from a question I asked myself: What sort of language would people speak if the language of the Anglo-Saxon invaders had merged with that of native Celtic speakers in Wessex, 1500 years ago? Wessisc is my attempt to answer this question. Also, in the conculture, Wessisc died out approx. 3-500 years ago, so I am also attempting to reconstruct Wessisc, thus mirroring the culture on the reconstructed natlang Cornish. It is currently in the early stages of creation.  The website was down for a long time, but will shortly be relaunched.  [Damon M. Lord]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_xliponian.htm">Xliponian</a></dt>
<dd>Xliponian (the letter x is pronounced like a sh) is an Indo-European language spoken almost exclusively in the Kingdom of Xliponia. It is derived from the vulgar Latin of the Roman imperial conquerors who occupied the region in the early centuries of the Common Era. The main feature that distinguishes Xliponian from other Romance languages is the soundshift suffered very early by some consonantal sounds.  [Ronald Kyrmse]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_yivrian.htm">Yivrian</a></dt>
<dd>Yivríndil is a historically rigorous <i>a priori</i> conlang, with a fair degree of completeness. It's sonorous and fluid, with a preference to open syllables and few consonant clusters. There are several related languages that have been designed, but are much less complete.  [Jesse Bangs]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_ziotaki.htm">Ziotaki</a></dt>
<dd>It's a cross between English and Japanese, with some extra features thrown in for fun.  Ziotaki pronouns have an obligatory ingroup-outgroup distinction and pronouns can carry a suffix to indicate which referent in a sequence they refer to.  [Shihali Ramichu]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_zoggian.htm">Zoggian</a></dt>
<dd>This is a fully isolating language, where there are no word classes, no declensions, no conjugations, just an ordering of words in sentence makes the meaning.  [Jan Havli&#353;]</dd>
