Even <a href="/db/ups_spanish.htm">Spanish</a> doesn't have this segment! Where can I find the sources from which you extracted this data?"<br><br>F. Wood writes, "You report 35 as the phonemic inventory for <a href="/db/ups_zulu.htm">Zulu</a>, including only four vowels.  Essentially all authorities on the ground in Africa report almost sixty consonants and five vowels.  How did you arrive at such a large mismatch to the conventional understanding in South Africa?"<br><br>I've always clearly indicated the possibility of error with my conversion of the <a href="/upsidlanguages.htm">UPSID database</a>. I first put up my UCLA Phonological Segment Inventory Database (UPSID) conversion out of frustration that this data was not readily available in some form.  I'm a big fan of UPSID (using its aggregate data to guide the design of <a href="/db/mdl_kalisise.htm">Kali-sise</a>).  <br><br>Can someone with Mac Prolog check to see if my conversion reflects the <a href="/db/rsc_upsidmacprologinterfa.htm">Mac Prolog data</a>?  If not, I can try to fine-tune my conversion process.  If my HTML pages do match, then the Prolog implementation is wrong.  Please <a href="/contact_form.htm">contact me</a> with any ideas.

I had ambitions for writing something about <i>A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i> but don't have the time and the moment has passed.  However, two conlangers did chime in:  Zompist with a <a href="https://zompist.com/rants05.html#7">Hitchhiker's rant</a> about criticisms of the movie and Jose Martinez with a <a href="https://jleag.com/27">Hitchhiker's comic strip</a>.

His birthday wish was for links to his <a href="https://www.scripting.com">Scripting News</a> weblog.  <br><br>I first read about Dave in the late 1980s in a magazine article in <i>MacWorld</i> or <i>MacUser</i> about his founding of UserLand Software to make scripting tools for the Macintosh.  I remember a picture of him by his swimming pool in his house.  I remember thinking that "UserLand" was a great name for a software company.<br><br>When I stopped being an industry analyst and co-founded <a href="https://www.perseus.com/">my own software company</a> in 1993, I was thrilled when shortly thereafter Dave started sending out informal e-mail newsletters, which he jokingly called <a href="https://davenet.scripting.com/1994">DaveNet</a>.  We didn't have an office, and my partner and I typically worked from our own homes, so it was pretty lonely, coding all day and night.  Each DaveNet was a welcome relief and a reminder of the wider industry I wanted to be part of, as a software developer this time.  Dave had written an interesting bit of code that would send the newsletter to six people at a time: in the "To:" line you would see five other subscribers, selected at random.  This was in the days before privacy concerns, and the randomness was a subtle networking aid.  Now this was also in the days before spam, so imagine my surprise one day when Bill Gates hit Reply-All to six of us for Dave's piece, "<a href="https://davenet.scripting.com/1994/10/18/billgatesvstheinternet">Bill Gates vs. The Internet</a>"!<br><br>DaveNets have gone the way of the dinosaur.  We used to think the dinosaurs all went extinct, but the nimble ones evolved into birds.  DaveNet evolved into <a href="https://www.scripting.com/">Scripting.com</a>, the longest continuously running weblog.<br><br>What does all of this have to do with Langmaker.com, you wonder?  Well, Langmaker.com also started as a newsletter (<a href="/ml00.htm">Model Languages</a>) before evolving into a website.  Inspired by Scripting.com, I evolved its home page from a <a href="/whatsnew.htm">changelog</a> into a <a href="/199907.htm">weblog</a>.  And because Dave co-invented <A href="https://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss">RSS</a>, I added an RSS feed to Langmaker.com.  If you subscribe to any RSS feeds, you have Dave to thank for popularizing the format, and I hope you'll join me in wishing him a happy birthday!</font></div><br><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#006699" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="ThanksforAllTheFish"></a>Thanks for All The Fish<small> - 5/01/05 - 9:59 pm</small></font><div><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><img src="/db/pcmag.com" align="right">Langmaker.com was named by <a href="https://www.pcmag.com">PC Magazine</a> this week in a cover story as one of the "<b>Top 100 Sites you didn't know you couldn't live without</b>":<blockquote>This site for hobbyist model language inventors invites you to get lost in topics like <a href="/ml0103a.htm">Gymnastics with Onomastics</a>, which discusses naming conventions, and <a href="/ml0108b.htm">Emulating Tolkien</a>, which celebrates the creator of such popular languages as <a href="/db/mdl_quenya.htm">Quenya</a>, <a href="/db/mdl_sindarin.htm">Sindarin</a>, and <a href="/db/mdl_adunaic.htm">Adûnaic</a>.</blockquote>Thanks to John Quijada, creator of <a href="/db/mdl_ithkuil.htm">Ithkuil</a>, for pointing this out to me.  Thanks to the <a href="/aboutus.htm">volunteers</a> who help keep the directories updated.  Thanks to you readers for all <a href="/submitheadline.htm">your submissions</a> to the directories!<br><br>This may be the oddest weblog on the Internet, and it's certainly <a href="/db/stats.htm">grown far larger</a> than I ever imagined.  I'm truly honored, shocked and humbled at the recognition from a mainstream publication.  My aim has always been to increase awareness of our unique hobby, so that -- eventually -- when you tell people you invent languages for a hobby, they know what you're talking about.  Thanks to <i>PC Magazine</i>, and thanks to the Academy.</font></div><br><div><a href="log_0504.htm">Prior Month's Entries</a></div>
