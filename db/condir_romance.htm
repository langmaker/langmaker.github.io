<dt><a href="mdl_aercant.htm">Aercant</a></dt>
<dd>A model Romance language. Inspired by Spanish, Italian and also Romanian, has a very strong Eastern Romance bent. In my opinion, a number of trends not seen in other "real" Romance languages.  Retains cases, for instance.  [Michael Bush]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_aingelja.htm">Aingeljã</a></dt>
<dd>Aingeljã (Angelian) is the neo-Romance language invented by Ángel Serrano. It is mainly inspired in those already existing, such as (in order of importance): Spanish, Catalan, Galician-Portuguese, French and Italian, with some Germanic influences from English and German.  [Ángel Serrano]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_brandonian.htm">Brandonian</a></dt>
<dd>Brandonian gender is determined differently than in most other Romance languages: nouns ending in a consonant or O are masculine, and ones ending in A or E are feminine. Most masculine nouns end in a consonant, except when it would be impossible to pronounce the word, so an O is added. In the same fashion, most feminine nouns end in a double letter plus an E, except for when pronunciation is impossible. Perhaps the most unique aspect of Brandonian is that double letters followed by an E, found in feminine words, are pronounced differently than their singular counterparts.  [Jordan Kay]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_brithenig.htm">Brithenig</a></dt>
<dd>One of the best of the fictional languages on the web. Brithenig is the language of an alternate history, being the Romance language that might have evolved if Latin speakers had displaced Celtic speakers in Britain. Brithenig has undergone sound changes similar to those of Welsh, and has borrowed from Old Celtic and from Old, Middle and Modern English.  [Andrew Smith]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_brujeric.htm">Brujeric</a></dt>
<dd>Brujeric (also called Franco-Castilian) is a Romance language invented for an epic fantasy I plan to write sometime in the near future.  It essentially blends a very Spanish phonetic system with a rather French lexicography, but it also has a few direct Latinisms as well as a few unique emergent attributes to add to the sense of authenticity.  Grammar is a roughly equal blend of French and Spanish influences.  [Gregory H. Bontrager]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_dosian.htm">Dosian</a></dt>
<dd>The language has a somewhat different layout than other Romance languages and has slightly different inflections - and a larger set of phonemes.  [Steve Nickolas (Dosius/Usotsuki)]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_fortunatian.htm">Fortunatian</a></dt>
<dd>The vowel changes and mergers are (I think) unique among Romance languages. The neuter case survives, and a retroflex series existed at an earlier stage. Elision has had great effects on the original Latin.  [Marcus Miles]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_ibran.htm">Ibran</a></dt>
<dd>A Romance language which on paper looks much like French or Provencal, but whose pronunciation deviates even more from Latin than either.  [Muke Tever]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_interlingua.htm">Interlingua</a></dt>
<dd>Developed by an organization that was originally founded in New York in 1924 to choose one constructed language to support as an auxiliary, the International Auxiliary Language Association eventually created its own language, with a grammar derived from the Romance languages and a vocabulary drawn from western European languages. Not to be confused with Latino Sine Flexione, which was later called Interlingua. (Before IALA/Interlingua, the Academia pro Interlingua had a language with the same name; they later gave Gode permission to use the name after the IALA had informally adopted it.)  [International Auxiliary Language Association]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_jovian.htm">Jovian</a></dt>
<dd>Jovian is a fresh new romlang (constructed Romance language) concept starting from the venerable and plentiful resources of the High Latin language and taking it where no romlang has gone before.  Its phonology is quite unusual for a romlang, and includes a few well-behaved mutation patterns.  [Christian Thalmann]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_kerno.htm">Kerno</a></dt>
<dd>Padraic Brown writes, "Kerno is one of the principal historical languages of Rheon Kemr (the Kingdom of Cambria), descended from the Vulgar Latin spoken by the Romano-British of the 1st through 4th centuries AD. Specifically, it is a continuum of dialects of the West British branch of the Romance language family. Its historical boundaries are the Severn Valley in the north, the Avon in the east (in the regions of Sorbadunon) and the Loire Valley in the southeast."  [Padraic Brown]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_latinomoderne.htm">Latino Moderne</a></dt>
<dd>Latino Moderne is based on IALA Interlingua. The vocabulary for LM is the same as that of Interlingua, but Stark has rejected Interlingua's grammar, which he views as oversimplified and hard to use in practice, especially in regards to pronouns. The grammar of LM is instead a distillation of that of ancient Latin and the modern Romance languages. Learning Latino Moderne can serve as a good foundation for later study of Classical Latin or a modern Romance language.  [David Th. Stark]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_linkaromanika.htm">Linka Romànika</a></dt>
<dd>It is a regular-enough Semiticized Romance language.  [Dana Hadar]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_nemeritvie.htm">Nemeritvie</a></dt>
<dd>Nemeritvish (Nemeritvie in its own langauge) is a conlang created by Argentine Luciano Nicolás Parisi circa 1996, and nowadays growing continuously. Nemeritvish is a language derived from Latin, and it could be considered a Romance language. From the very beginning, Nemeritvish was created with the objective of become a language that could make up for and cover absolutely every aspect of the linguistic communication that natural languages cover, even those with such an extensive vocabulary as English, French, Spanish, Japanese, etc. That is to say, that it's a language that really could be used, that it's so complex and varied when referring to technical terms, vulgarism, informal modes, etc.  [Luciano Nicolás Parisi]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_reman.htm">Reman</a></dt>
<dd>Reman is not just another romlang. It takes the Romance language to a direction that has never been taken before, even by other Romance conlangs. From Latin, it has lost grammatical genders, lost agreement between nouns and adjectives, lost most of the conjugations, merged prepositions and conjunctions as well as adjectives and adverbs, and created a subjunctive future tense from the Latin future participle! :) Moreover, its conjunctions/prepositions <b>must</b> be followed by the indirect form of pronouns, even when those are the subject of a verb (when the particles are used as conjunctions), a little like it happens with some Arabic particles.  [Christophe Grandsire]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_romanova.htm">Romanova</a></dt>
<dd>Language materials have been translated into Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, Russian and more languages, making it one of the most serious of the newly constructed contenders for IALs.  [multiple contributors]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_romula.htm">Romula</a></dt>
<dd>This Babel text is in (La Lingua) Romula, an artistic Romance language of mine, used in an alternative Earth, in 3 countries -  Pania and Clairmont (in the Biscayan Gulf), Ellenia (Mediterranean). These  are the texts in Central, Panian dialect of Romula.  [Artemio de Cosma]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_sermo.htm">Sermo</a></dt>
<dd>Sermo can be understood without study by almost all speakers of Romance languages. It can be used to immediately communicate; Sermo is a simple and phonetic language.  [Jose Soares Da Silva]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_slezan.htm">Slezan</a></dt>
<dd>Slezan is a Slavo-Romance language, which originally came into being as a satellite project of Wenedyk but then emerged into a separate language rather than a dialect). It is spoken in Silesia in the alternate timeline of Ill Bethisad.  Wenedyk's phonology and orthography are entirely based on Polish; Slezan does something similar with Czech, but in a far more liberal way. Its grammar is much more "Romance" and much less "Slavic" (for example, unlike Wenedyk, it has only two cases).  [Jan van Steenbergen]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_talossan.htm">Talossan</a></dt>
<dd>Madison has invented the imaginary country of Talossa (which claims part of Milwaukee as its sovereign territory). Talossan is a Gallo-Romance language, inspired by French, Provencal and Occitan, and very naturalistic (with quite a few irregularities). Little of the language is available on the Internet, but Madison does sell three books about Talossan: two dictionaries and a grammar. With over 20,000 words, it is one of the most detailed fictional languages ever invented. A principle weakness of the language is that it has no fictional derivation from Latin, with forms having been invented arbitrarily rather than regularly.  [R. Ben Madison]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_tundrian.htm">Tundrian</a></dt>
<dd>Tundrian is a Romance language spoken in the imaginary country of Tundria, which lies to the west of France in the Atlantic Ocean. The country is imagined as if it was part of the real world, i.e. if there was really such an island, it could conceivably be as it is imagined. The language is based on Latin, and it underwent phonetic, morphological and other changes similar to those that have led to other (real) Romance languages. Among its characteristics are the preservation of the nominative/accusative cases in the definite article, nouns and adjectives, and the preservation of intervocalic voiceless stops (as in 'sapeir' [to know], 'fata' [fairy], 'pacar' [to pay]).  [Gábor Sándi]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_wenedyk.htm">Wenedyk</a></dt>
<dd>Wenedyk (in English: Venedic) is a Slavo-Romance language. Officially, it is a descendent from Vulgar Latin with a strong Slavic admixture, based on the premise that the Roman Empire incorporated the ancestors of Poles in their territory. Unofficially, Wenedyk just tries to show what Polish would have looked like if it had been a Romance instead of a Slavic language.  Wenedyk is one of the languages of the Republic of the Two Crowns in Ill Bethisad, where it replaces Polish.  [Jan van Steenbergen]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_xliponian.htm">Xliponian</a></dt>
<dd>Xliponian (the letter x is pronounced like a sh) is an Indo-European language spoken almost exclusively in the Kingdom of Xliponia. It is derived from the vulgar Latin of the Roman imperial conquerors who occupied the region in the early centuries of the Common Era. The main feature that distinguishes Xliponian from other Romance languages is the soundshift suffered very early by some consonantal sounds.  [Ronald Kyrmse]</dd>
