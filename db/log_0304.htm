Related to this, I've had four or five questions lately about why submissions aren't published more rapidly.<br><br>I typically space out the publication of items to the web site a day at a time -- i.e., a new Babel Text every day, a new Model Language submission every day.  This gives people more of a chance to review what they see on the site.  If there are more than two weeks of items already scheduled, then a submission is just assigned a random time in the next two weeks.<br><br>I process updates more quickly.  Items are updated whenever I enter them into the database (every few days to once a week), but then are assigned a future date to be featured on the home page.<br><br>I publish less than a third of New English submissions.  I just publish the ones I like or find interesting.  I sometimes don't publish ones that I think are borderline offensive or inappropriate (because kids read this web site).  It really just comes down to my personal preference.</font></div><br><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#006699" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="TakingABreak"></a>Taking A Break<small> - 4/16/03 - 12:00 am</small></font><div><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">I've made a lot of changes to the site this past month:<ul><li>Added a comic strip</li><li>Added historical auxiliary languages</li><li>Added an automated statistical analysis of the languages indexed</li><li>Added a Top 100 countdown</li><li>Added a right sidebar to the web site listing recent additions</li><li>Added this web log</li></ul>In early May, it will become clear why I did this, but for now I plan on taking a break.  Don't be surprised if I stop updating the site for a week or ten days, but I will resume my regularly scheduled programming after that.  The site has been running smoothly for a year now, with almost daily updates since last March, after two years of no updates (hey, I was busy with work and it was tedious to update the site before I automated most of it).

Most languages were submitted by their authors using <a href="/mlindexsubmission.htm">this form</a>.  Here's a list of <a href="/db/mdl_index_languageauthor.htm">language authors</a>.  The languages are like Esperanto in that they are invented.

Gender in the grammatical sense doesn't need to be related to sex. Basically it indicates concordances of classes of words, with the classes traditionally called masculine, feminine nd neuter, due to a rough sex-reference correspondence in Indo-European languages. Better, though, to think of them as categories, meaningless or meaningful depending on the language.  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&q=%22women%2C+fire+and+dangerous+things%22+gender">Some further references</a>.</font></div><br><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#006699" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="AtlanteanTattoos"></a>Atlantean Tattoos<small> - 4/06/03 - 8:08 pm</small></font><div><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Megan writes, "I'm turning eighteen soon and am going to be getting a tattoo.

I would enjoy discussing Furbish if you would like. I'll give you one quick bit of info that no one knows.  The choices of the consonants were made for two reasons:</p><ol><li>The speech compression is LPC, so sounds that LPC could not do so well were left out.</li><li>This creature was designed for young as well as old and consonants that sound close were left out to avoid confusion.</li></ol><p>Sounds that could be mistaken, or easily misunderstood as profanity, were also left out.</p></blockquote>I don't know much about compression, but apparently <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/speakfree/windows/doc/compress.html">LPC</a> is pretty low tech, and therefore suitable for a mass-market toy.  Raymond Brown had suggested that <a href="/furbish.htm#Phonology">Furbish phonology</a> might be an indication of the unique physiology of Furbies.  He was right in a way!  For the record, I think what delighted Dave Hampton so much was the utter seriousness with which we evaluated his work back then.
