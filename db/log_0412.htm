It is not properly a translation, but a demonstration of what a tlhIngan Hol (Klingon Language) Bible would look like.<br><br>Why a Klingon Bible?<br><br>Once anyone hears of a project to make a Klingon Bible, the question that comes up is "why?" Certainly there is no need for such a version, as there is a need for a Bible in English, Spanish, German, or any other "real" language. There is no person who would only be able to access the scriptures in Klingon.<br><br>But in the study of artificial languages, translating standard works of literature like the Bible is often done, and for two reasons. First, it is a way to exercise and develop the language, and second, it helps to develop a body of literature in that language. This literature can then be used and referred to by people learning and using the language.<br><br>For some, there can be other benefits. Though this kind of translation might seem frivolous, the work of producing such a translation can have devotional value even if the translation is never used. The effort of reading the scriptures and considering their meaning for a translation cannot fail to benefit the translator by helping him or her develop a deeper understanding of the text.<br><br>The Klingon language community has produced at least three efforts in this direction. The Klingon Language Institute organized a long-term project to translate the Bible. Currently on hiatus, this project has yielded only a few books, for example, the Gospel of Mark. In addition, the Rev. Glen Prochel published a book, <i>Good News for the Warrior Race: Vaj SeghvaD De' QaQ</i> (now out of print), which presents the gospels and other selected scriptures in parallel with a <i>Star Trek</i> English paraphrase.<br><br>Lastly, the project presented here, the Klingon Language Version, is actually a relexification of the World English Bible and serves as a demonstration of what a complete Klingon Bible would look like. A table of the most frequently occuring words (used more than 100 times) was translated, word by word, into Klingon. This table was used to transform the Bible into Klingon. Though it is not a grammatical Klingon text (actually it is more of a pidgin-Klingon, mixing English vocabulary and grammar with Klingon) it does provide vocabulary which can be used in doing a proper Klingon translation.</blockquote></font></div><br><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#006699" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="EsperantoMovieNightmares"></a>Esperanto Movie Nightmares<small> - 12/29/04 - 1:20 pm</small></font><div><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><p><img src="https://ia.imdb.com/media/imdb/01/I/62/59/28m.jpg" align="right">Bruce V.

Since the middle 1970s when calculators appeared in schools, I have used these words in math lessons to teach factorization in a fun way.

I had never heard that SHELLOIL was the inspiration.  Very neat.  I too was surprised that there wasn't a full lexicon of calculator words anywhere else.

There is nothing like three neat straight lines for simplicity and ease of scribing or hacking with your handy knife, axe or deer antler.  (This appeals to my masculine side.)</li><li>It is visually representative of the sound it represents.

Put them together |< = K.</li><li>K for kool!</li></ol>As for C, surely this confused and overused consonant deserves a rest.  Does it sound like an S or a K, or even a CH?  Is it followed by an A, O or U or by an E or an I (or an IE or EI)?  People have even resorted to one of the most inelegant jottings - the cedilla - all in an attempt to clarify which of the numerous sounds of C they wish us to utter.<br><br>For all my aspirated glottal plosives, give me a K any day.</blockquote></font></div><br><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#006699" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="ReadytoSubmit"></a>Ready to Submit<small> - 12/16/04 - 8:12 am</small></font><div><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">I <a href="/db/log_0412.htm#NaNoWriMoNoMo">had planned to catch up</a> on submissions by now, but it has taken longer to recover from <a href="/db/log_0411.htm#UpdateonLackofUpdates">my hard drive crash</a> than I expected.

Also, are affixes less likely to undergo spelling changes than actual words?"<br><br>I can't imagine any reason why affixes would undergo spelling change differently for affixes than for entire words.  The spelling might be the same for two different versions of the language (Old and Middle, Middle and Modern).  Of course, spelling change is a good point to declare a distinction between the langs.  Spelling change might not be the result of sound change at all -- it might be done for political purposes, adopting a different script than enemy speakers of the same language (thinking of Serbo-Croatian, where one side of the divide uses the Latin alphabet and the other side uses Cyrillic).  Spelling change might also happen for reasons of prestige -- symbols from an ascendant culture might be borrowed (think of Japanese use of Chinese characters).</font></div><br><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#006699" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="40000ConlangersCantBeWrong"></a>40,000 Conlangers Can't Be Wrong<small> - 12/13/04 - 5:01 pm</small></font><div><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Whimemsz writes:<blockquote>You are quoted as saying, "The community of hobbyists is a large one, with approximately 40,000 people in the United States having invented their own languages and some 250,000 having used model languages such as Esperanto, Quenya and Klingon."

Once we spent $100,000 to interview consumers to develop a five-year forecast; other times people would ask for a quick "ballpark" estimate, and I would create a back-of-the-envelope calculation. Each time the result was five numbers, but the confidence in those five numbers was vastly different.  The joke in the industry is that forecasts are like sausages -- you don't want to know what goes into them.<br><br>I don't recall all the ingredients of that particular estimate, but I looked at some book sales figures and some overall population numbers.
