Gibson's controversial film <a href="https://www.thepassionofthechrist.com/"><i>The Passion of the Christ</i></a>, opening today, utilizes two tongues from <i>way</i> back in the day: Latin and Aramaic. the Aramaic spoken today, called the Eastern group of dialects, is different from the Aramaic spoken by Jesus Christ, dubbed the Western group, a branch that is considered extinct.  That made it difficult for [the Rev. William] Fulco to translate the <i>Passion</i> script, as no one really knows how Jesus spoke.  "We don't know much about ancient Aramaic," says Fulco, who stitched together a language from a variety of sources, including the Old Testament of Daniel, fourth-century Syriac and Hebrew. "Almost every town had a different dialect. I created a possible reconstruction and had to coach all the actors."</blockquote></font></div><br><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#006699" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="MistakingaToponymicforaPatronymic"></a>Mistaking a Toponymic for a Patronymic<small> - 2/26/04 - 12:54 pm</small></font><div><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Kalina writes in, "I was disappointed to find that Polish names formed with -<i>ski/-ska</i> (as in the given example <i>Jaruzelski</i>) are called patronymics [in <a href=" https://ml0103a.htm">Gymnastics with Onomastics</a>], while they [did not originally] refer to a person's father but to a person's 'home town'.

From a humble beginning of just seven links, the <a href="/resources.htm">Resource</a> collection has grown into 78 resources.</li><li>In March 2002, I realized that thanks to David Salo's <a href="/bibliotheca.htm">Bibliotheca Sagittari</a>, I had a ready-made directory of conlang-related books and videos, which formed the kernel of the <a href="/booklist.htm">Books</a> directory (in fact, David has entered 141 books out of the 168-item collection; come on, <a href="/add_book.htm">add a book</a>!).</li><li>In April 2002, I realized that "Weaver's Dictionary of Verbifications", a short faux dictionary that I wrote in high school, could form the kernel of a <a href="/newenglish.htm">New English</a> directory of invented words (and, in fact, I have entered 96 words of the 651-item collection, of which 51 words were from the original collection). It quickly became the second-most popular feature of the site after the Model Languages directory.</li></ul>And with the New English collection making five directories, there the number of directories has remain fixed for the past 22 months.<p>Back in December 2003, I began a productive <a href="/db/log_0312.htm#Jamalina351311FileJam">e-mail exchange with Mattias Persson</a>, who first wrote in to tell me, "I love writing systems, and I often look for updates at Langmaker and at Simon Ager's <a href="https://www.omniglot.com/">Omniglot</a>".  In a hobby comprised of unique individuals, Mattias stands out for his singular devotion to inventing writing systems.  <a href="https://www.algonet.se/~lamperss/">His site features six of his writing systems</a>, but it turns out he's invented over 60 scripts, yet finds it too hard to keep his site updated.  When I realized that Omniglot, a site I love, prefers to list only <a href="https://www.omniglot.com/faqs.htm#newalph">distinctive constructed writing systems</a>, I realized that a win-win-win situation would be for Langmaker to add a directory of constructed writing systems:  a win for Langmaker.com, because it adds a visually attractive section to the web site;  a win for Mattias, because it makes it easier for him to share his work and easier for him to see other's scripts;  and a win for Omniglot.com, which concentrates on providing a wonderful overview of natural-language scripts with highlights from some famous constructed scripts.<p>I've decided to call the section Alphabets, because that is shorter than "Writing Systems" and less ambiguous than "Scripts";  the term "Alphabet" is often used generically to mean any writing system, though it also used specifically to distinguish alphabets from abjads, abugidas, syllabaries, and ideographies.  Please <a href="/add_alphabet.htm">add your own writing system</a> to our new directory!<p>I'm proud to dedicate the new <a href="/alphabets.htm">Alphabet</a> directory to Mattias Persson, in celebration of his dedication to constructed alphabets.</font></div><br><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#006699" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="ThankstoDavidJPeterson"></a>Thanks to David J.

I noticed that Langmaker.com is written partly or wholly in XML. My question is: how does one create a link in XML to a specific page using CSS?</blockquote>I actually don't think you want to create a site in XML.  You want to create a site in HTML where the HTML references a CSS.  The XSL language for transforming XML is quite complicated, and is not the technique you see on sites today (XSL is to XML what CSS is to HTML).<br> <br>Static pages on Langmaker.com are published using <a href="https://www.globalscape.com/cutesitebuilder/">GlobalSCAPE Web Site Builder</a> (originally created by Dan Bricklin, co-inventor of the spreadsheet).  Dynamic pages (the "/db/*" pages) are generated from data files containing the information about each language, Babel Text, New English definition, etc. and using a custom program I wrote.<br> <br>The only XML file on the site is the <a href=" /db/langmaker.xml">RSS feed</a>, which is used to syndicate recent changes to the site using a <a href="https://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/">news reader</a> or a blogging service such as LiveJournal.</font></div><br><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#006699" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="AppyPollyLoggy"></a>Appy Polly Loggy<small> - 2/09/04 - 12:20 pm</small></font><div><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">A sincere apology to everyone who is disappointed that I don't process their submissions to the site more frequently or keep them better informed about their submissions.  This site is just a mad hobby, and I typically let submissions pile up until some evening when I should be <a href="https://www.theonion.com/4005/news3.html">writing a presentation for work, I procrastinate</a> by updating the site instead.<br><br>Items typically pile up in my In Box for two weeks, then I chose which items to publish, then edit them and schedule them to be released over the next two weeks.  This gives the site the illusion that I work on it every day, and it gives you a reason to come visit each day.  Unfortunately this means it can take two to four weeks before your item is featured on the home page.<br><br>Even worse, if I reject your submission, I don't tell you.  I really find writing rejection notices unpleasant.  I don't tend to publish submissions for resources that are new (e.g., forums with few messages, newsletters with few issues); I prefer to wait for something to be established before sending traffic to it. I typically reject model languages if no link is included, or the site doesn't have much information.  Whether or not I accept a New English word almost comes down to a whim; I look for words that are well made and useful and could actually become used;  I reject words that are just borrowings from conlangs.<br><br>I also don't really have time to comment in depth on anyone's specific language.  I can barely keep up with the number of submissions to Langmaker.com these days (225 in my In Box as I began updating the site this round).  Your best bet for comments is to join one of the <a href="/db/rsc_index_resourcetype.htm#MailingList">mailing lists I reference</a> in the Resource section.<br><br>To save myself time, I've written my own software application to maintain the site, relieving me of much of the tedium.  As I expand this program, I can serve you better.  At some point, I will add a submissions-processing client with a "Reject" button that will give the reason a submission is rejected and that will tell you when a submission will be published.  I just don't know when I will get around to that.<br><br>I used to actually spend most of my conlanging time inventing languages; now I spend almost no time inventing languages because the site requires so much work.  Don't get me wrong;  I love Langmaker.com, and I'm pleased so many of you visit.  And I appreciate everyone who contributes, especially those who contribute regularly.<br><br>Thanks for proving once and for all that the secret vice is no longer secret.</font></div><br><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#006699" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="MoreWhistlingintheDark"></a>More Whistling in the Dark<small> - 2/08/04 - 12:47 pm</small></font><div><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Eragon writes in:<blockquote>Someone was asking about more information on <a href=" /db/mdl_silbogomero.htm">Silbo Gomera</a>, as I recall, on your site.

Don't we all. Try Alex Connell (very difficult to track down) - he was the 1st to play Millers recording 2 me. Maybe he knows better - if anyone can find him - would be really delighted to hear from him. That having been said to contextualise 'pompetus' into a working OED I'd say something along the lines of: "Sarah said I'm me. Sod everything else. Just love me for what I am. Escape from the pompetus..." Imagine an imaginary Sarah saying that to you. To hell with the pompetus...enough. By the way should it be spelled "pompetus" or pompatus" ?
