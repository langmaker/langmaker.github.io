In a language that has a written form, will sound change affect spelling? For example, if /p/ changes to /t/ would the word 'pala' turn into to 'tala' or would 'pala' be spelled the same, but pronounced /tala/? Thank you for your time."<br><br>Well, the answer is up to you, depending on what makes sense for your <a href="/db/eng_conculture.htm">conculture</a>.<br><br>Maybe, for your language's speakers, spellings aren't standardized.  For instance, speakers of English in Shakespeare's day were lax about how they <a href="https://www.houseofnames.com/xq/asp/sID./kbId.106/title.Spelling+Variations/qx/knowledgebase.htm">spelled their own names</a>, let alone others: <i>Shackespeare, Shackespere, Shackspeare, Shackspere, Shakespear, Shakespeare, Shakespere, Shakspeare, Shakspere, Shaxspere</i> and <i>Shexpere</i> have all been attested <a href="https://shakespeareauthorship.com/name1.html">multiple times among Shakespeare's</a> contemporaries.<br><br>Alternatively, maybe the spelling is more important than the pronunciation:  the word we spell <i>cupboard</i> is pronounced /kubberd/, <i>nation</i> is pronounced /nash@n/.  And the English -<i>ti</i>- is a good example:  it is almost always pronounced /-sh-/ these days, though it was once pronounced /-ti-/.  Similarly, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana">hiragana</a>, the symbol that stood for /si/ now stands for /shi/, as the sound has changed but the symbol hasn't.<br><br>So you can the answer the question as you desire: either the spelling is bound to the sound, to an approximation of the sound or to the historic sound.

No wonder professional linguists have attacked the language like piranha.<br><br>Wikipedia also says, "The culture is concerned solely with matters that fall within direct personal experience, and thus there is no history beyond living memory."<br><br>From an evolutionary standpoint, it is clear that speakers of Pirahã are at a dramatic disadvantage compared to cultures that do prize history (see <a href=" https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393317552/langmakercom/">Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies</a>) - those other cultures can learn from the distant past, where speakers of Pirahã don't have that opportunity.<br><br>This makes me wonder if Pirahã is the coelacanth of human languages.  Once many human languages were like Pirahã, but their speakers were wiped out or assimilated by speakers of more modern languages.  Then this strange fish of a language was pulled out of the Amazon basin, offering us a glimpse into what the distant past of human language may have looked like.</font></div><br><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#006699" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="LabialMajority"></a>Labial Majority<small> - 10/24/04 - 4:24 pm</small></font><div><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Sprogisc wrote, "I found this site about a year ago, and it got me started on conlanging.

However, I have a question that I think you might have the human resources to answer. Are there any living languages in which there are no labials? I would like to create my conlang without labials, but I think that this might be unnatural in a language, since labials are so easy to make, especially for infants.

It's a similar system, but more elaborate and not pidgin.  Actually, Kali-sise has a lexicon that large that it blows my head off.  When did Jeffrey have the time to do <i>that</i>??"<blockquote>Kali-sise is based on the Dublex compounding system, which was a collaborative effort supported by many visitors to this site and CONLANG subscribers.  There's an <a href="/db/rsc_dublexcompoundinteres.htm">Excel spreadsheet</a> that will allow you to enter 400 roots and have your own compounds generated.<br><br>As for finding the time, the average American watches 4 hours of TV a day: as an unaverage American, I only watch sporting events (my "reality TV"!) and some kid shows, so on average I watch a half hour of TV a day (which most weeks is just a 3.5-hour football game).  I try to spend at least 15 minutes a day on Langmaker.com, and then odd moments as I find them on my own conlangs -- at least an evening a week.  My other time-saver is that I have automated Langmaker.com, so it is no longer tedious to maintain.  (Of course, since first writing this, I've just watched 35 hours of baseball this past week, but the Red Sox beating the Yankees for the pennant can't be considered an average week!)</blockquote>In the same thread, <b>Trebor Jung</b> said, "I am not insulting Dublex, Jeffrey; I like that project and would definitely be disappointed if you ever scrapped it!"<blockquote>It will never be scrapped; in fact, inspired by the <a href="https://www.lojban.org/publications/etymology.html">Lojban etymological dictionary</a>, I placed the Dublex materials in the public domain, which means I renounce all copyright to it and anyone can use it however they wish.  Dublex is intended as a framework that others can use to develop their own languages.  As an example, I've used it in such a way with Kali-sise.</blockquote><b>BPJ</b> asks, "How come there are no verbs in the <a href="/dublexlexoutline.htm">Dublex Lexical Outline</a>?"<blockquote>Because Dublex, like most of my languages, derives all other parts of speech, including verbs, from nouns.</blockquote><b>Sally Caves</b> and I corresponded about Dublex as well.<blockquote>Hi, Jeffrey... I love <i>pig</i> for "buttock"<br>Me: I liked it too -- pronounced /peeg/. But it's become /galuta/ in the unnamed eclectic stepchild of Dublex I'm working on these days.<br>Sally: How interesting... it's <i>gallohs</i> in Teonaht: /ga'luS/. <i>Timgalohs</i> for both of them. :)  And I borrowed <i>vov</i> for "egg" in <a href="/db/mdl_teonaht.htm">Teonaht</a>.<br>Me: That's great! I'm glad you liked it. The word <i><a href=" https://x.htm#vov">vov</a></i> was a pictograph to me as well:<blockquote>vOv - an egg in a bird's nest</blockquote>Sally: Yes.

Peterson</a> writes,<blockquote>You mentioned that you <a href="/db/log_0409.htm#GenitiveDisorder">eliminated the genitive case</a> because it's not a core case.  While I agree with your reasoning for the purposes of <a href="/minhyan.htm">Minhyan</a>, you should know it's not that simple.  The genitive is the one thing that continues to puzzle linguists--so much so that it's all but ignored (this probably has a lot to do with the fact that everyone's a syntactician in America, and morphology, typology and historical linguistics are all but taboo).  <br><br>The thing is, the genitive shows up as a core case in just about every language that has it (i.e., it's treated more like the nominative and accusative as opposed to, say, the prepositional, ablative, etc.).  There's no real reason why it should, though, and in this your logic is sound, and many others have said as much.  But the fact remains that the genitive seems to constantly participate in VPs (Verb Phrases) in unexpected ways.  For example, the genitive will often mark a direct object (usually only a certain type--it's never the main method for marking a direct object), and sometimes even the subject of a sentence, for a certain class of verbs (this is true of Latin).  Further, once you've left the main clause, the genitive is frequently used to mark the subject or object (or both) of an embedded VP.  Take English, for example:<blockquote>I ate the cake.<br>I beat the man in a race.<br><b><i>My</i></b> eating <b><i>of</i></b> the cake was appreciated by all.<br>The <b><i>man's</i></b> beating in the big race was witnessed by all.</blockquote>The one part of this that actually has interested syntacticians is the uncanny resemblance an NP bears to a sentence as a whole.  Most languages can take an entire verbal sentence (like "I ate the cake") and turn it into an NP using the genitive or some kind of possessive construction (like "My eating of the cake").  It's really a sticky issue that hasn't gotten enough attention, and I think what's behind it is the question: Are one's actions one's own?</blockquote></font></div><br><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#006699" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="SuiteSixteen"></a>Suite Sixteen<small> - 10/11/04 - 10:24 pm</small></font><div><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">I extended the <a href="/kalisiselessons.htm">Kali-sise lessons</a> to sixteen.

It shouldn't be that difficult to understand for the non-linguist.</li><li>Additionally, for Sheli, a language I'm working on that's supposed to be an actual tone language, I have two pages that describe <a href="https://dedalvs.free.fr/sheli/history.html">how the tone system evolved</a> and <a href="https://dedalvs.free.fr/sheli/tone.html">how it's used presently</a>.  I'm less linguistically certain about these pages than that of the pitch-accent system, but they serve my purposes nicely.

I would like the language to be as simple as possible to learn yet very fun.  I would like to use words that are inherently funny sounding, like <i>spoozle</i> or <i>narf narf</i> but have run out of ideas.  Do you know of any significant lists of funny words, other than just ten or twelve entries?  I think I could hijack the grammar from <a href="/db/mdl_tokipona.htm">Toki Pona</a>, but if you have any other suggestions, please let me know."<br><br>I'd raid Dr. Seuss books for some good ideas for funny words.  And you can generate more by taking English words of Anglo-Saxon vintage and <s>tweaking</s> "queaking" them (for example!).<br><br>As for grammars, remember: one source is plagiarism, and two sources is research!  I'd check out the <a href="/kalisisegrammar.htm">Kali-sise grammar</a> and the <a href="https://www.geocities.com/gayvegangenius/tati/grammar.html">Ta Ti grammar</a> for ideas.<br><br>Good luck!
