This will continue for many more decades. I reckon that by 2040, when Mandarin is the language of commerce and technology, the English speakers of the world will heartily (and tardily) endorse the idea of a simple international language. Of course, the Mandarin speakers of the world won't see much need for one."</li></ul>Interestingly, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/">the Telegraph</a> recently posted its own question and answer on this future: <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2005/06/12/do1203.xml">Who can stop the rise and rise of China?

There are pockets of speakers globally. South America and Africa in particular have vibrant pockets of speakers, and they exist almost everywhere. Your selection of China and Japan is interesting only because these two countries in Asia have significant "pockets" of speakers. I would have said they have comparatively strong populations of speakers myself.<br><br>I'd refer you to this site as just one very pessimistic (arguably realistic) <a href="https://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/profcon/e_kiom.htm<br>">estimate for Esperanto speakers globally</a>.  Alas (unless you are conversant with it), it is in Esperanto, but all the columns containing numbers are someone's estimate for the number of speakers in each country.

I've also taught myself Italian and Latin.  Among my hobbies is inventing foreign equivalents to obscure American or otherwise English names that have no historically standard equivalents.  For example, we all know that <i>Charles</i> becomes <i>Carlos</i> in Spanish, so there's no reason <i>Bruce</i> can't become <i>Bruzo</i>.  My philosophy is to re-formulate the name to fit the phonotactics of the target language, while allowing it to retain enough orthographic resemblance to the original that it can be easily recognized.<br><br>More examples:<ul><li>Brooke = Broca or Bruca (Sp.), Brocca or Brucca (It.), and Broque or Brouque (Fr.)</li><li>Clark = Clarco (Sp. & It.) and Clarques (Fr.)</li><li>Jessica = Chésica or Jésica (Sp.), Jessique (Fr.), and Gessica (It.)</li></ul>I have also created name equivalents for my conlang, which brings me to the point of this correspondence.

We've got answers.<br><br><b>Q</b>: I'm thinking about starting a new conlang, and despite all your great resources here, I was wondering if you could suggest any ways to give a language its own unique sound.  Are there any phonological rules that make a language sound smooth?<br><b>A</b>: Smoothness is in the ear of the beholder, but many people prefer words with CV and CVN syllable structures (Consonant+Vowel+Nasal), avoiding consonant clusters.  I typically like CVK structures, where K is a subset of C (something like /n/, /m/, /ng/, /r/ and /l/ for instance).<br><br><b>Q</b>: How did Tolkien achieve the sound of <a href="/db/mdl_quenya.htm">Quenya</a>?<br><b>A</b>: He began with a finished product:  he started with a natural language he liked and then refined that phonology to better suit his preferences.  I tried (without success) to learn from this with <a href="/ml0108b.htm">Emulating Tolkien</a>.<br><br><b>Q</b>: Also, are there any basic phonological rules that all languages follow to facilitate speaking?  <br><b>A</b>: Fewer than you think.  Languages create all sorts of monstrosities (like English <i>strengths</i>, a CCCVCCC syllable, where /ng/ and /th/ are each single consonants).  And then there's the languages that say, "Vowels, we don't need no stinking vowels."<br><br><b>Q</b>: And finally, what resource would you suggest as a basic starting point for learning terminology (i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plosive">plosives</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fricative">fricatives</a>, etc.)?<br><b>A</b>: The Wikipedia's section on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manner_of_articulation">Manner of Articulation</a>.</font></div><br><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#006699" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="TheNakeTruth"></a>The Nake Truth<small> - 6/09/05 - 6:35 pm</small></font><div><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a href="https://www.zompist.com/">Zompist</a> writes in about the recent submission of <a href="/db/eng_nake.htm">nake</a>, "1. Taking off your clothes. 2. Taking off someone else's clothes."<blockquote>In fact <i>nake</i> is the opposite of a neologism (paleologism?)-- it's the original form of the word.  It meant 'strip' or 'peel', and 'naked' is simply the past participle.  You could use it of fruits as well as people.  <br><br>The OED reports that <i>nake</i> goes back to Old English <i>nacian</i>, and beyond that to Indo-European.  It seems to have died out in the 1600s as a verb, though they do have a citation from 1887.</blockquote>Thanks, Zomp.
