<dt><a href="mdl_abakwi.htm">Abakwi</a></dt>
<dd>James Finley writes, "Abakwi is an agglutinating language with a simple grammar and a naturalistic sound, spoken by the Ndake of the Mamberamo Basin. <i>Tak-ungg'u q'e, makamak-ul'Edoba q'ubara-sha, shatash-ang-ish'e.</i> 'You well know, that the Edoba would feast on their own mothers if it were not tabu.'"

<dd>[Bruce Foerster]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_adelic.htm">Adelic</a></dt>
<dd>With a vocabulary derived from Indo-European roots along lines similar to, but distinct from, the Germanic family of languages, Adelic has a rich internal history, giving it the sound and texture of an old European language and making it well suited for gaming.  The site features a grammar, sample texts, a unique script and a dictionary with over 2,000 words.  [Scott MacLagan]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_adunaic.htm">Adûnaic</a></dt>
<dd>The language of Númenor, the lost continent of Atlantis.  [J.R.R. Tolkien]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_aeksnotrinodikem.htm">Aeks Nótrï Nódikem</a></dt>
<dd>Aeks is intended for the artist, designed to have ultimate flexibility in structure and vocabulary while maintaining logic through affixes that designate position in sentence structure.  [Niki Eve White]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_aelitian.htm">Ælitian</a></dt>
<dd>It's basically a modified form of Latin. The most notable of the differences is the pronunciation. Other differences include an alternate grammar and word order.  [Matthew See]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_aeo.htm">Aeo</a></dt>
<dd>It only has three phonemes, for crying out loud! Yay!  [Jonathana Tegire]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_aertran.htm">Aertran</a></dt>
<dd>Aertran is the language of the elves in the World of Hexalthermia.  Like all Aertran languages, it has affixes to determine plurality (singular, dual, plural, total) and case (nominative, accusative, dative, locative).  In Aertran, verbs, not nouns, have gender, and the word order in a sentence changes slightly depending on the gender of the verb.  [A.B. Basham]</dd>

<dd>[Rory]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_almalinian.htm">Almalinian</a></dt>
<dd>Unlike some of the more aesthetic conlangs out there which often have fairly complex grammatical rules, Almalinian was created to be both highly beautiful and grammatically simple so that it could be quickly learned.  [Bryant K.]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_alphasmart.htm">Alpha Smart</a></dt>
<dd>[Jack Durst]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_alurhsa.htm">Alurhsa</a></dt>
<dd>Large number of phonemes, heavy diacritic use.  [Anthony Harris]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_anaqaen.htm">Anaqaen</a></dt>
<dd>The most unique aspect of Anaqaen is the use of vowel morphing to show tense and number.  Also, the language uses suffixes (and a couple of prefixes) to replace certain pronouns and adjectives (mostly the articles).  [Chris Bouchard]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_ancallonlanguages.htm">Ancallon languages</a></dt>
<dd>Ancallon is a continent created for an RPG (role-playing game) campaign. The eight main languages of Ancallon are each described in just a paragraph or two; some are based on natural languages (English, Welsh, Irish), while the others are invented (Konamoata is patterned on Hawaiian, and Banrok provides the obligatory :-) ergative language).  [Aran Kuntze]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_andorian.htm">An'dorian</a></dt>
<dd>While less well known than the officially sanctioned Klingon language, An'dorian is as richly developed and represents the language of the blue-skinned Andorians from the original Star Trek TV series. Over 3000 words are defined, along with a grammar and sample texts. Andorian has eight noun classes and an elaborate TMA system.  [Spence Hill]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_anglosaxoncomputerese.htm">Anglo-Saxon Computerese</a></dt>
<dd>Not every constructed language has to be large and complex. Anglo-Saxon Computerese is the hundred or so terms you would need to be able to talk about computers in Anglo-Saxon (Old English). Most terms are compounds of real Anglo-Saxon words: for instance, the word for "computer" is <i>circolwyrde</i>.  [Carl T. Berkhout]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_anikin.htm">Anikin</a></dt>
<dd>Anikin is a speakable version of Tolkien's in a mix with "real" languages. At the same time, it sounds (on the one hand) very nice, and (on the other hand) it has a quite regular grammar.  [Felix Brender]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_anklis.htm">Anklis</a></dt>
<dd>Anklis has changed dramatically over the past year that I have been working on it. Anklis has been heavily inspired by some of the ideas of Basic Anglo-Saxon English and features only words derived from Germanic languages. More on this will be explained when I post a language history. It is still based on Modern American English, but with various sound changes and shifts, as well as a phonetic alphabet and simplification of grammar rules. Website will be up soon.  [Martin Ferretti]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_antapa.htm">Antapa</a></dt>
<dd>This language was developed for the fantasy story "Song about the Nothern Star". The language has two faces: an ornamental and time-wasting eminent one and an somehow malicious and fizzing second one.  [Jan Havlis]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_apralios.htm">Apralios</a></dt>
<dd>Apralios is an important language (in its speakers' eyes especially) in Thegim (my conworld), spoken in the country of Apralos and numerous neighboring countries.  [Christopher Mules]</dd>

<dd>[Kelahäth Ohar]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_asmeni.htm">Asmeni</a></dt>
<dd>The language plays a similar role on the planet Asamen that English plays on Earth:  the most widely spoken second language, used in commerce and diplomacy. It has many grammatical features that I have not been able to trace but also many that are in real languages.  [Kári Emil Helgason]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_asnai.htm">Anaî</a></dt>
<dd>Anaî is a tonal polysynthetic conlang that focuses on the noun, and uses a syllabary.  [Maknas]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_asrorddanis.htm">Asrord-Dânis</a></dt>
<dd>[Asier]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_atevi.htm">Atevi</a></dt>
<dd>Atevi is dependant upon math to keep the sentences harmonious & not infelicitious.  [C.J.Cherryh; Rodlox]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_attrendian.htm">Attrendian</a></dt>
<dd>This language makes use of a good deal of inflexion, providing a good deal of versatility in meaning.  For example, the noun has three possible "spheres of existence" in that suffixes are added to a noun to denote its existence in the domestic, communal or natural sphere.  [Kevin R. VanDenBreemen]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_aulingese.htm">Aulingese</a></dt>
<dd>[Andre Steffens]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_avarin.htm">Avarin</a></dt>
<dd>A separate language family from Eldarin (which contains all the other Elvish tongues covered here), Avarin is almost completely unexplored. If you ever wanted to derive your own Elvish language, you can invent an Avarin tongue, descended from Primitive Elvish.  [J.R.R. Tolkien]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_ayeis.htm">Ayeis</a></dt>
<dd>It has a vocabulary of Indo-European/Germanic style but an original grammar, mostly based on my own invention and from some pre-Indo-European languages. I intend the vocabulary to be related to some other languages of my invention, but it has many relations with Indo-European and Uralic roots.  [Asier G.]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_ayeri.htm">Ayeri</a></dt>
<dd>A trigger language with many nasals, liquids, and /a/'s.  [Carsten Becker]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_ayhan.htm">Ayhan</a></dt>
<dd>What used to be known as Saalangal is now Ayhan. The name change was made to simplify it, and also because it reflects the change from something unsettled to something that I've finally decided needed to stay grounded, rather than scatterbrained. I've still kept its Philippine bent, but I've changed the verbs (it is sadly no-longer a trigger language, that bone of contention which had kept the language from settling down). However, it still has a very South East Asian Austronesian flavor, on the surface, but is still very much my own creation, pulling bits of grammar that I rather like.  [Barry Garcia]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_babalo.htm">Babalo</a></dt>
<dd>"Ajin Kwai is the author of this language, I simply posted on the Auxilingua Project website the information I was sent on projects by this language author." --J. Bowks 6JUL2004  [Ajin Kwai]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_baronh.htm">Baronh</a></dt>
<dd>Language of the Abh people from Morioka's novel, <i>Seikai no Monshou</i> ("Crest of the Stars").  The grammar and common words and unique alphabet can be found in his novel "Seikai"-series and in anime based on his novels.  [Hiroyuki Morioka]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_barsoomian.htm">Barsoomian</a></dt>
<dd>The language of Edgar Rice Burrough's Martian series (A Princess Of Mars, The Gods Of Mars, Warlord Of Mars, etc.) added greatly to the verisimilitude of Barsoom and inspired many constructed language designers.  [Edgar Rice Burroughs]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_barushlani.htm">Barushlani</a></dt>
<dd>Barushlani is a pronominalizing language with three genders (gods & men; women, children and animals; and inanimate). Gender is shown in the verb. The language is also a showcase for the <a href="/db/rsc_kura.htm">Kura linguistic description application</a>.  [Boudewijn Rempt]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_basicanglosaxonenglis.htm">Basic Anglo-Saxon English</a></dt>
<dd>An unimaginative derivative of Basic English, replacing all words not of Anglo-Saxon origin.  [Jeffrey Henning]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_biyuron.htm">Biyuron</a></dt>
<dd>[Pablo Flores]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_blaaninian.htm">Blaaninian</a></dt>
<dd>Blaaninian is a succinct and flexible language, designed in theory to sound like a cross between ancient Greek and Hebrew, although this is not always achieved in practice.  [Lord Blaa]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_blackspeech.htm">Black Speech</a></dt>

<dt><a href="mdl_bruceish.htm">Bruceish</a></dt>
<dd>Bruceish is (obviously) an artificial language I have been working on for the past two weeks. I aimed to minimize irregularity and create a simple (yet effective, if slightly ambiguous) way to quickly turn roots into more usable words. It is still very much a work in progress; the PDF I have supplied explains only basic grammar and perhaps a hundred or so roots. Eventually, I will add a more complete explanation of the mechanics and perhaps post some poetry that I have written in it.  [Bruce A. Brejta]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_brujeric.htm">Brujeric</a></dt>
<dd>Brujeric (also called Franco-Castilian) is a Romance language invented for an epic fantasy I plan to write sometime in the near future.  It essentially blends a very Spanish phonetic system with a rather French lexicography, but it also has a few direct Latinisms as well as a few unique emergent attributes to add to the sense of authenticity.  Grammar is a roughly equal blend of French and Spanish influences.  [Gregory H. Bontrager]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_c24.htm">C-24</a></dt>
<dd>C-24 utilizes Disambiguating Polysemy.  [Anthony Docimo]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_calennawn.htm">Calénnawn</a></dt>
<dd>Calénnawn is spoken by the humanoid bipeds (<i>cúsibe</i>) on the planet Caléntuy in the solar system of Ingúded. There are regional and cultural differences in pronunciation and usage. Calénnawn is one of the first languages in which I cultivated exceptions, as elements to make the language interesting.  [René Uittenbogaard]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_canil.htm">Çanil</a></dt>
<dd>Çanil contrasts short and long consonants and vowels, uses ablaut grammatically, and has a vertical script.  [Maknas]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_caolaeg.htm">Ca'olaeg</a></dt>
<dd>The language was formerly called Nochpaq and then Noshbhasa.</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_cetonian.htm">Cetonian</a></dt>
<dd>If you have ever wondered what language whales might speak, you will be interested in Cetonian, the language that the extraterrestrial cetaceans of the planet Wuiou (called Cetonia in English). All words are made up out of eight syllables, each approximating a sound that can be made by the cetacean's blowhole: ha, ho, hui, ma, o, u, wa, and wui. A typical sentence is huiuwui.ha.uhuiu.wui.ho.huiwaho, "The dolphin bit the fish." Landau looked to the songs of Terran whales and dolphins for inspiration.  [James E. F. Landau]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_chmtlondor.htm">Ch-m Tlondor</a></dt>
<dd>Almost all of Tlondor's words are bound morphemes; i.e., they must combine with other morphemes to create words.  A noun typically consists of a set of consonants such as <i>n-m-</i> "person"; a verb is generally a suffix such as <i>-achax</i> "speak"; aspect is an infix such as <i>-o-</i> (progressive); they combine morphologically to create a sentence (<i>nomachax</i>, "the/a person is speaking").  [Jeff Lilly]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_chusole.htm">Chusole</a></dt>
<dd>Chusole is the language of the Empire of Kiarlon in the land of Korhano, a fictional setting that includes a number of other languages and cultures as well.  It is not terribly unusual in terms of Earthly languages, but as it develops, it should reflect the culture and history of the Kiarloni people.  A grammar, lexicon, and script are currently under construction.  [Glenn Kempf]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_cilthic.htm">Cilthic</a></dt>
<dd>Cilthic is an attempt to combine concepts and features from several Earth languages in such a fashion as to create a foreign yet familiar tongue.  This philosophy is mirrored in the associated fantasy conworld project, Sorukan, which I have tried to make familiar yet non-clichéd.  [Daniel S. Andersen]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_ciravesu.htm">Ciravesu</a></dt>

<dt><a href="mdl_cispa.htm">Cispa</a></dt>
<dd>Miller has invented quite a few languages spoken by the furry aliens of Mizar, including Cispa, for which he has published on the Web a font for the Cispa alphabet, a short grammar and a dictionary.  [Herman Miller]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_clalia.htm">Clalia</a></dt>

<dd>Justin B. Rye wrote, "Of all the toy languages I've sketched out over the years, this is the only one I've built to order!  A friend offered to pay me a few quid (or was it pints?) if I'd give him a language suitable for use as background colour in a roleplaying campaign he ran... I didn't even take the step of naming my brainchild - it just received a tongue-in-cheek serial number.  The contrast with the stereotypical in-depth approach just made it more fun!"  [Justin B.

<dt><a href="mdl_curco.htm">Curco</a></dt>
<dd>It's a typical sample of inflecting SOV languages, but it's different from the rest of my languages in that it's derived from another one, with a lot of carefully studied changes. Curco is a bastard child of Draseléq <https://www.geocities.com/pablo-david/draseleq.html>, where the baroque exuberance of the parent language have crashed against a new a much more simple lingua franca, Ciravesu <https://www.geocities.com/pablo-david/ciravesu.html>, showing pidginizing tendencies. It's the only language I've made that is derived from another full-fledged constructed language.  [Pablo Flores]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_dekavurian.htm">Dekavurian</a></dt>
<dd>Dekavurian is the name of yet another of the languages which is, or rather will be, featured in my book. The variety presented here, properly referred to as Classical Dekavurian or Common Dekavurian, is supposed to have been spoken by colonists who arrived in the south-east of the land in which the early Liotans were then living, and is thus contemporary with Proto-Liotan.  [Geoff Eddy]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_delason.htm">Delason</a></dt>
<dd>Delason is the fictional language of the fictional Mediterranean country of Salamon. Delason's phonology is "a regularized marriage of Spanish and Modern Hebrew." Its vocabulary is drawn from 20 natural languages; unfortunately, etymologies aren't listed on the site. The language has its own script, visible using Internet Explorer or Netscape version 4.0 or later browsers, if dynamic fonts are enabled (otherwise the text will simply appear twice).  [Nizar Habash]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_delendian.htm">Delendian</a></dt>
<dd>Delendian or Dyalintí is a simple language, so it shouldn't be too difficult to learn, though it would not be classified as a logical language.  [John Shilpetski IV]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_dementian.htm">Dementian</a></dt>
<dd>Dementian is an incredibly easy language to learn. You never need to learn much, because similar words are all alike, as in the case of where, here and there, which are omibu, omiba and omibo. Read the Phrasebook (unfinished), and you will understand more of my concept.  [Jeremy Boyd]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_denden.htm">Denden</a></dt>

<dd>The language is supposedly the root of all human tongues. It's spoken by Leeloo in the movie <i>The Fifth Element</i>, and only bits and pieces  of it are available. It's an interesting language to say the least. The  URL listed appears to be the only place where the language is even  considered. Every other page is just a fan-boy of the movie itself.  [Luc Besson]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_doraya.htm">Doraya</a></dt>
<dd>Doraya is the language of an imaginary world consisting of the regions of Mofeva, Doryn and Rooken. The most fascinating part of the language is the relative roles of nouns and verbs. Verbs are invariable, while nouns take special modifiers to indicate tense. The subject typically is modified for tense, and the direct object may be modified for tense as well. A sample sentence: so silidae e silinae sorn, 'until future-you and future-me are together', "Until I see you again."  [Adam Parrish]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_draconiclovarin.htm">Draconic (Lovarin)</a></dt>
<dd>Draconic is meant to be the language of the dragons in Lovarin. It has only a few hundred native speakers scattered about the world who only use it rarely. It is difficult to pronounce and has a tricky grammar. Sentences tend to be long due to difficult clusters, long word length, and extensive use of particles. Rather than semantic opposites (good/bad), the lexicon is mostly based around semantic triplets.  [Ikkakujyu]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_draseleq.htm">Draseléq</a></dt>
<dd>Linguistic uniqueness: no elements in the language are really unique, but their combination is, unless some incredible coincidence has happened. Among rare traits (for speakers of Western languages) are the adjectives being merged with verbs, and verbs having a lot of room for derivational morphology, making it possible to say, for example, "having been officially commanded to punish oneself again" in one word. Personal uniqueness: it's the only language I've made with which I've been able to write stories and poems, and translate big chunks of things I love, like the Lord of the Rings.

<dt><a href="mdl_ebisedian.htm">Ebisédian</a></dt>
<dd>Ebisédian is well-known for its other-worldliness due to its being set in a fictional universe that has radically different physical laws, and for its aptitude in causing dramatic distortions to relay texts. However, beneath the surface, what distinguishes it the most linguistically is its unique typology, in which the active voice and the passive voice are one and the same, expressed through a unique semantically-based case system. So far, no one has been able to name a natlang that has a similar typology; yet once one understands it, it makes sense and feels quite natural.  [H. S. Teoh]</dd>

<dd>The author writes, "Just as Latin was replaced first by Vulgar Latin and then by Italian, Anglo-American English will give way first to international English and then to Europanto, the difference being that this process will take place far more quickly... although it is not a language as such, Europanto does exist. But it is, as yet, rather amorphous and any attempt to try and describe the language and write down its grammatical rules would be rather like planting a seed and wanting to take a photograph of the tree."

<dd>While most alien conlangs use grammars that follow the universal grammar of humans, Fith specifically violates linguistic universals and could never be spoken by a human in actual practice.  The grammar is based on the principals of a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure ("stack").  Humans can translate Fithian texts that have been written down, but due to the nature of the grammar - where words can be spoken long before their semantic role, if any, is apparent - no human could learn to translate Fith in real time, due to the demands Fith places on memory, introducing words before they are used and rearranging the order of words on the fly.  [Jeffrey Henning]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_florish.htm">Florish</a></dt>
<dd>An aggluginating VSO language. The appearance is like that of Finnish, mostly consisted of long words with endings instead of separate articles, etc. The sound structure was borrowed from Quechua, except I removed /ch/, /ñ/, /ll/ and /w/ and added /v/. Aside from /d/ in the cluster /and/, /v/ is the only voiced non-nasal consonant in the language. Most words are original, but Finnish and Quechua inspired some of them.  [Kata Valinta]</dd>

<dd>It's not a human language, so I expect it to be different from most human languages, though it's too soon to tell yet (the language is less than two months old when I write this). It's got a purposefully difficult phonology, which I doubt any human language has, and a strange case system mixing the (already rare) ergative/absolutive system with our familiar nominative/accusative system, according to the person of the subject and object. It doesn't have third person pronouns (not that strange, really -- Latin didn't either), and it has five levels of deixis: things on the speaker's power, things at hand, things within sight, things not within sight but perceived by smell, touch or intuition, and things outside the reach of one's senses. This deixis system is, as far as I know, unique.  [Pablo Flores]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_gevey.htm">Gevey</a></dt>
<dd>Gevey has been brewing for over 25 years, and has developed a number of idiosyncrasies during that time. For instance, the concept of "object status" is highly important in the language. The detachable relative clauses are fairly unique (using a system of conjunctions inspired by switch case). "Associated" and "dissociated" forms of each noun are also a central part of the language.

Whilst Low Drow is used by the Ilythiiri (Drow elves) with non-Drow races and in common conversation, High Drow is restricted to formal circles and ritual purposes.  To be fluent in High Drow marks one as not only educated but also of considerable rank in society.  In many ways it functions not only as a class marker but as a secret code -- fiercely guarded by the nobles and priesthood as 'privledged knowledge', it can be used to converse privately even when surrounded by other (non-noble) Drow.

So, my strategy was to take a universal (namely, all languages have large open classes of nouns and verbs) and violate it. So, Kélen lost all of its verbs and became a language of nouns and particles." - Sylvia Sotomayor  [Sylvia Sotomayor]</dd>

It is the language of Cats and other felines of our age. It is intended to be musical and well-sounding. Its basic vocabulary is from Egyptian, and as it is, mainly VSO, though it has a lot of cases and agglutinates words for everything.   LW belongs to the Meyadhewic language family, whose child languages descend from Archaic Meyadhew. a language spoken by the carnivores of our Earth around 65 million years ago.  LW is the language of the feline culture, education and literature. I have a lot of texts in LW, as many translations as native LW ones. For more info, see the web site.

<dd>Moten is unique not in its features but in the way it combines them. It has number, case and definition marked on nouns, but those are basically marked by a combination of infixes and suffixes. Each case is intrinsically trisemic, having an abstract, a spatial or a temporal meaning, depending on context (two prefixes can be used to disambiguate). It also inflects only the last part of a noun phrase. Verb conjugations rely heavily on analytical forms (in fact, only the verbs |agem|: to have and |atom|: to be have actually conjugated forms - and only five - and all other verbs are conjugated by added nominal forms of them to the conjugated forms of those auxiliaries). It also uses overdeclination (the declination of an already declined form) quite often, both with nouns and verbs (it's the main way to create subclauses).  [Christophe Grandsire]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_nordicg.htm">Nórdicg</a></dt>
<dd>Nórdicg is a language with its very own style. Its look is heavily indo-european-influenced, but the grammar is an invention of my own. It has a special way of verb conjugation, a rarely used syntax, and it uses some rare and obsolete characters, for example the hooked o. There are no irregular verbs, and every type of word, except for nouns, prepositions and conjugations, is indicated by a special suffix, so you can easily 'switch' one type into another. The letters 'w' and 'y' are special letters, as they can either be used as vowels or consonants. Words can be combined to long word chains, with a special word order to indicate the most important part. The accentuation is derived from Irish Gaelic. Nórdicg has 3 genders, singular and plural, of which one can either be the plural neuter, or a group of male and female persons. So there is no unnecessary sexism as in French, for example.

<dd>Obrenje is a fairly well-behaving language.  Phonology is aesthetic in a rustic but fluid way, using six vowel phonemes and consonants with palatized allophones.  Orthography is totally regular but non-trivial.  Vocabulary is a priori.  Syntax is liberal VSO with some useful OVS structures.  Grammar is mostly inflecting or isolating, with somewhat complex but reasonably regular verb paradigms, and nouns inflecting for definiteness (and nothing else!).  It has a native script.

Odonien was designed as an OSV language, and does not use prepositions or postpositions. Instead, it divides all nouns into adjuncts to nouns and verbs, and uses case particles to indicate the relationships. The aim of Odonien is to make sentences as succinct as possible. The language has a unique script, a primer and approximately a thousand words.  [Steve Oostrom]</dd>

It is no longer used in everyday speech, but still used in religious rituals, and for official treaties and the like. It is still taught to most educated Kandar, and is now more often written than spoken.

<dt><a href="mdl_olelic.htm">O'lelic</a></dt>

Indeed, nearly every cluster and aspirate in O'lelic is an import from another language, the earliest forms of O'lelic being without any.  Also unusual in O'lelic is the fact that there is no verb conjugation. Instead, there are a set of particles, which may be called Verb-marking Particles. These precede or follow the verb in a sentence, indicating and modifying the meaning.  [Curtis Mullings]</dd>

<dd>This language is for evil plans and terror. It sounds bad, but it has interesting facts. Transitive and intransitive verbs have different conjugations; there is a tense called Unreal that's very difficult to understand and to use, and all verbs start with letter "o"  [Eugenio M. Vigo]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_shkanshej.htm">Shkanshej</a></dt>
<dd>It uses a trigger system, by which the focused argument of the verb is marked as such without showing its function (subject, object, etc.). This function is instead marked on the verb. This system is combined with a gender system with three genders conven  [Pablo Flores]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_talossan.htm">Talossan</a></dt>
<dd>Madison has invented the imaginary country of Talossa (which claims part of Milwaukee as its sovereign territory). Talossan is a Gallo-Romance language, inspired by French, Provencal and Occitan, and very naturalistic (with quite a few irregularities). Little of the language is available on the Internet, but Madison does sell three books about Talossan: two dictionaries and a grammar. With over 20,000 words, it is one of the most detailed fictional languages ever invented. A principle weakness of the language is that it has no fictional derivation from Latin, with forms having been invented arbitrarily rather than regularly.  [R. Ben Madison]</dd>

<dd>Tasratal is a noun-based SOV agglutinative language, with two primary parts of speech: connectives ("function" words, or particles) and substantives ("content" words, or nouns). Verbs are typically formed from nouns using a causative connective.  Syntactically, connectives and substantives occur in "triads,"  indicating "opposition or assertion", "uncertainty or motion", "status quo".  <i>icevan-ge aferun-mas-kyx, yferun-co-roq</i>. /itSevanNe apferunmaski"S i"pferuntSorox/   "To find happiness, one should not seek it."

They are thought of as having spiritual or extraterrestrial origins, they are compared to the elves of European legends and Tolkien's Middle Earth, the jinn of Islamic folkore, and demons or fallen angels under a more-or-less Christian interpretation. They see themselves and are seen by others as a highly advanced race compared to humans."  [Danny Wier]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_teonaht.htm">Teonaht</a></dt>
<dd>You won't find a personal language being actively developed that is as deep and rich as Teonaht. Much is unique about it, from its word order to its verbal system to its affixing. It uses the rare OSV word order, can front the subject (SOV), yet repeats the pronoun before the verb. While a nominative language, Teonaht distinguishes between "volitional" and "non-volitional" verbs and subjects, so that the nominative has two forms, "agent" and "experiencer," also reflected in the verbs. Teonaht lacks the copula in the present tense. It has "the Law of Detachment," whereby affixes can switch from final to initial position in a word for rhetorical or prosodic purposes; this allows the tense suffix to detach and prefix the pronoun (an innovation copied by NGL). While putatively Indo-European, Teonaht draws very heavily from an unknown inflected language called "Nenddeyly".  [Sally Caves]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_thereskeya.htm">Thereskeya</a></dt>
<dd>Thereskeya was designed to be the tongue of a very proud nation led by a female monarch named the Candace. The language flows quite nicely, having plenty of continuants. It has a surprising lack of grammatical gender while retaining very complex verb conjugations. The dialect presented on the site is that of the capital city Bornas, which lies in a declension limbo between the full case system of the traditional rural population and the lack of case present in many city dialects.  Here is an example phrase from the language:  <i>Thonath belo khelbit auriswelespit.</i> "I soar over sunlit lands."  [Ben Poplawski]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_tisjelan.htm">Tïsjelán</a></dt>
<dd>Tïsjelán has grammar with Altaic, Uralic, and Athebaskan aspects (with a syntax very much like that of Japanese), and a phonology consisting of 14 consonants--13 of which have 3 distinct allophones that differ in place of articulation and are almost separate phonemes--and 14 vowels.  [Jonathan North Washington]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_tomouliniganmaa.htm">Tomoulini Ganmaa</a></dt>

<dt><a href="mdl_tran.htm">TRAN</a></dt>
<dd>This is an unusual language, with two very interesting features: first, a unique morphology for cases, and second, unusual formation of noun/verb pairs. Cases are marked on the end of preceding words (so, Vagu gat is "A cat sitting", where -u marks the case of gat, "sit"); this is well suited for forming compound words, e.g., tanosharasvanak is tan ("house") o-shar ("of selling", genitive) a-svanak ("drugs"), "pharmacy". Finally, verbs are formed from nouns by transposing the initial and final consonants: e.g., <i>tran</i>, "speech", becomes <i>nrat</I>, "to speak".  [Andrei Burago]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_valavya.htm">Valavya</a></dt>
<dd>There may be two slightly different forms of a word or conjugation; the speaker's aesthetic tastes determine which one will be used. It's a language meant for slow, careful intonation, not everyday speech. A language for poetry, not conversation, to be savored on the tongue like fine wine...and it only has one irregular verb! One!  [Mariana Lo]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_valmelind.htm">Valmelind</a></dt>
<dd>It tries to combine some features regarding sea peoples. As it is the language of the sea-elves it has a unique alphabet and a complex agglutinative grammar, but the vocabulary is simple and no longer than three syllables.

<dd>This is Vash. I started it when I was 16, 43 years ago. First it was a secret language, then it was a device to uncover the Chomskian deep structure, then one to uncover the principles of creolization. Now and for the last 25 years or so it is just an obsession. It is an Indo-European language with copious Germano-Slavic antecedants. It is pretty amazing to learn that I am far from the only one who has done this.  [Peter Ramsey]</dd>
