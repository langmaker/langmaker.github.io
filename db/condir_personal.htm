<dt><a href="mdl_acian.htm">Acian</a></dt>
<dd>It uses a special method of word creation, and uses a never-before-used method of verb conjugation by conjugating infinitive forms of verbs to display past, present, and future.  [Ace]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_aestari.htm">Aéstari</a></dt>
<dd>Aéstari is my personal language that I've been developing for two years.  When I first started making it, I knew nothing of phonology, so it sounds horrible, and has gone through lots of major revisions.  It is spoken by the people of Aéstari and Gieborna on an imaginary planet I created.  [Nick Kalivoda]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_aingelja.htm">Aingeljã</a></dt>
<dd>Aingeljã (Angelian) is the neo-Romance language invented by Ángel Serrano. It is mainly inspired in those already existing, such as (in order of importance): Spanish, Catalan, Galician-Portuguese, French and Italian, with some Germanic influences from English and German.  [Ángel Serrano]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_andanese.htm">Andanese</a></dt>
<dd>See "Design Principles".  [Andrew Leventis]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_angloromance.htm">Anglo-Romance</a></dt>
<dd>I'd define Anglo-Romance as a jargon rather than a real language since it corresponds to an increase in Latinate words in written English. For the Romance speakers, it requires to learn English in order to adopt its simple grammar.  For the English speakers, to try to increase the number of Latinate words they commonly use.  [Mattia Suardi]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_animalic.htm">Animalic</a></dt>
<dd>Animalic, a simple language made by Tolkien's cousins, was the first of someone else's constructed languages that he was exposed to, and it inspired Nevbosh.  [Mary Incledon; Marjorie Incledon]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_anklis.htm">Anklis</a></dt>
<dd>The language is a possible future version of modern English derived from various sound change rules which have occurred in English in the past, as well as various dialect features of the various American English dialects. While it is derived from modern English, there are some areas in which Anklis is very different from English, particularly in its sounds, and some of its grammar.  [Martin Ferretti]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_antiquelantian.htm">Antique Lantian</a></dt>
<dd>I created this language for the people who lived a long time ago on my imaginary island, but this is the older form, which would be replaced by the new Lantian, that comes from Latin. <i>Ho creato questa lingua per la gente che viveva tantissimo tempo fa nella mia isola di fantasia, ma questa è la forma più antica, che verrà rimpiazzata dal nuovo Lanzio, che deriva dal Latino. </i>  [Bucchianeri Marco]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_antur.htm">An'tur</a></dt>
<dd>The consonant system (voicedness/unvoicedness), the use of pre- and postpositions instead of cases. Pronunciation uses only the front of the mouth (no velar, uvular, glottal sounds, no back vowels).  [Sander Dieleman]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_atarel.htm">Atarel</a></dt>
<dd>Atarel is an invented language. The name is based on the Japanese word <i>atarashii</i>, "new".  [Seiji Suenaga]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_azak.htm">Azak</a></dt>
<dd>Azak is agglutinative. But when I mean agglutinative, I mean <b>really</b> agglutinative, so agglutinative that after seeing it you'll get sick of seeing any other agglutinative language for a while :)) . Also, it has strange phonotactics. Syllable struct  [Christophe Grandsire]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_bac.htm">bac</a></dt>
<dd>Bac was originally designed to be a language which did away with the polarities of many natural languages (all that I was familiar with at the time). The verb has no objects, and -- at least to begin with -- neither positive nor negative was implicit in any word. It is striking in forming single clauses with multiple main verbs and is thus highly idiomatic to an Indo-European language speaker.  [Matthew Butt]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_benjish.htm">Benjish</a></dt>
<dd>Benjish is written with the Roman alphabet, and is based on Spanish, English and Greek.  It has two /R/ phonemes, one is the alveolar tap (as the Spanish letter <i>ere</i>) and one is the alveolar approximate (as the English /r/).  It also has a click.  It is the Official Language of the made-up province of Benjaland in Niwic.  [Benjamin Bruce]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_cannic.htm">Cannic</a></dt>
<dd>Cannic is an inflectional language and draws its vocabulary mainly from English. The grammar of Cannic is my own and has not been influenced by any language.  [Nikhil Sinha]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_cepperjoleddicg.htm">Cepperjoleddicg</a></dt>
<dd>I (Chris Paull, or as I'm known in the conlanging community, Zeke Fordsmender) began work on Cepperjoleddicg in a very different form in December of 1998. Today, Cepperjoleddicg is my most complete language project and my favorite. The language is a historically-possible primitive Scandinavian language with heavy Gothic influences and a touch of Goidellic. It's morphologically complex, phonologically rich, and packed full of idioms inspired by Germanic religion. It bears a complete literature, its own forms of poetry, and an alphabet and a set of runes.  [Chris Paull (Zeke Fordsmender)]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_chickenese.htm">Chickenese</a></dt>
<dd>Chickenese was originally created and documented as a joke in 1996 for a comedy/horror story I wrote called War of the Chickens, and was published in a zine called Basically Insane. It remained un-webified (is this a real word? It is now!) until 2004 when I discovered a reference online to another humorous and wonderful conlang parody called Chicken. In response to this, I decided to launch the Chickenese website. These two conceptually similar languages were developed independently at probably the same time for the same aim: just for fun.  [Damon M. Lord]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_cruons.htm">Cruons</a></dt>
<dd>Cruons is an artificial language consisting of mostly made up words, with some Dutch, Germanic and Roman languages. This language too is a dead language (no longer in use.)  [Stefan Lubbersen]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_cuerna.htm">Cuërna</a></dt>
<dd>Cuërna, a language which I have been working on for about a year, is truly one of the most beautiful languages in existence. Its grammar/formation is derived from a mixture of various European languages.  [Jack McNeill]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_cytrurian.htm">Cytrurian</a></dt>
<dd>Though it is derived from various Indo-European languages (mainly Germanic), it has a grammar and phonetic system unique to almost all world languages. Most words are derived from Old Germanic, but some of the sounds come from other languages such as Russian and Arabic.  [Martin]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_debiua.htm">Dêbiua</a></dt>
<dd>Dêbiua was inspired by the word construction system of Arabic, where roots are defined by consonant clusters, with vowels added according to a specific pattern to indicate fine meaning. Dêbiua uses a "dual" system, where roots are defined by vowel clusters and consonants are added for grammatical forms and fine meaning. Its sound system therefore contains an unusual high number of vowels.  [Hans Straub]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_degaspregos.htm">Degaspregos</a></dt>
<dd>[Tom Wier]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_derrae.htm">Derrae</a></dt>
<dd>It has a pretty regular phonology, but has a strange rule I called the Growing Rule, which states that, in some words, the order of the vowels isn't aleatory.  It has four invariable verbs: temporary "be", permanent "be", locative "be", and "have".  There are four persons: the speaker, the direct listener (to whom the speaker speaks), the indirect listener (who hears the conversation) and the subject (away from the conversation, natural things, etc.).  Nouns vary according to gender, number and definiteness: using an indefinite noun is the same as "a (noun)".  [Jotomicron]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_dialeka.htm">Di'aleka</a></dt>
<dd>Di'aleka has a simple grammar without losing expressiveness, and a wide ranging vocabulary to cover all topics. It also has a growing literature.  [Tristan Parker]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_dilingo.htm">DiLingo</a></dt>
<dd>DiLingo is a profound English slang with an ever growing vocabulary.  [sUmUs cAcOOnUs]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_dingwa.htm">Dingwâ</a></dt>
<dd>Dingwâ's lexicon comes mostly from Indo-European or else the oldest English root.  [David]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_doubledutch.htm">Double Dutch</a></dt>
<dd>Double Dutch is easy to learn and is mainly a code to talk to friends without teachers, parents or classmates knowing what you are saying. To translate a single syllable word into Double Dutch you take the word, for example: Hi Then you add 'Gether' infront of the word; Gether Hi Then you switch the first letter of the first word with the first letter of the second word: Hether Gi For multi-syllabic words like 'Hello' you split the word into it's syllables and treat each syllable as a separate word. For example: Hello Hell o gether hell hether gell gether o other go hether gell other go Other than that there is nothing else you need to know about pronouncing the words, but typing them is different.  [Unknown]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_draqa.htm">Draqa</a></dt>
<dd>[Ajin Kwai]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_dublex.htm">Dublex</a></dt>
<dd>Dublex is a langmaking game -- think of it as Scrabble for people who like to invent words. Rather than the letter tiles of Scrabble, Dublex has 400 word tiles. You combine the word tiles in as many ways as desired to come up with new words.  [Jeffrey Henning]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_eeee.htm">ê Èëe</a></dt>
<dd>The language of Eeee, or ê Èëe, is a tonal, isolating/inflecting language, created entirely for amusement, as was the "Cult of Eeee." It is not to be taken seriously except as the work of two geniuses.  [Jonathana Tegire and Jaaaaaa]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_egaeic.htm">Egaeic</a></dt>
<dd>[Edward Field]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_ehxduxadiikootu.htm">Ehxduxadiikootu</a></dt>
<dd>Split-S system, with the noun cases being used to determine tense. Complex derivational processes. Rather strange system of epistemic modals  [Various]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_eklektu96.htm">Eklektu 96</a></dt>
<dd>Unlike other of Herman Miller's languages, Eklektu 96 is not a language of furry aliens, but instead has a vocabulary containing an eclectic mix of the world's languages, though the emphasis to date has been on European languages.  [Herman Miller]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_eletanta.htm">Elet Anta</a></dt>
<dd>[John Fisher]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_elleya.htm">Elleya</a></dt>
<dd>The language is designed to be beautiful, yet easy to learn (but also rich).  It is designed so that it could have been spoken. It is full of irregularities.  [Niels van der Plas]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_epiq.htm">Epiq</a></dt>
<dd>Though I'm certain it's been done before, it's still rather rare to find a language whose roots lie in the Eskimo languages (and rarer still, the Caucasian languages).  [David J. Peterson]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_erone.htm">Erone</a></dt>
<dd>This is just a sketch of the language, but it is promising: Erone has an attractive lexicon, and I look forward to more to come.  [Carrie Schutrick]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_esata.htm">Esata</a></dt>
<dd>Esata is a modern creole based on a simplified English, with heavy international influences. It uses 'phrase words' which can be coined by its users to express more complicated vocabulary and concepts. There's also a new alphabet associated with the language, allowing the representation of up to 4 normal English letters in an easy-to-scan matrix.  [Pafu]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_esiterato.htm">Esiterato</a></dt>
<dd>There is no interspace between words and yet special sounds, prefixes or suffixes, sometimes infixes, give a clear indication of subjects, predicates, and so on. The whole sentence is a long, long word.  [Sandor Csak]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_etreraous.htm">Etrer'aous</a></dt>
<dd>This language has it's own sound ... almost a mix between middle-eastern, elvish dialects, and some of almost every language all combined in one to make it sound like its own and origonal. This is different also because the teachers of this language are greatly involved and concerned with the education of the learners.  [Drew Fischer]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_feianovedo.htm">Feianovedo</a></dt>
<dd>All prepositions are replaced by cases; simple conjugation.  [Sander Dieleman]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_fukhian.htm">Fukhian</a></dt>
<dd>The language was my first try, so it's not very absurd. :-) It's agglutinating with no constructed phonology.  The purpose was to remove all irregularity and concord from the language.  The unique thing is that every word can carry the verb affixes of a sentence in case the verb is dropped.  The script is very developed (but the letters need to be re-assigned to sounds).  [Henrik Theiling]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_galdyr.htm">Gälðyr</a></dt>
<dd>[Luca Galdiolo]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_goesk.htm">Goesk</a></dt>
<dd>Goesk was not meant to be unique, and has many features lifted from English and German.  However, a number of its features are decidedly Germanic-looking, yet independently contrived.  For example, the prepositions all govern the same three cases;  relative clauses are restrictive, non-restrictive, or free depending on the choice of pronoun;  reflexive pronoun phrases each comprise a demonstrative determiner before an accusative or dative personal pronoun;  the equivalents of English particles each comprise the word "fuer" (for) followed by a preposition.  Goesk contains many Germanic and European features modified for the heck of it.  [James S. Grossmann]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_goquim.htm">Góquim</a></dt>
<dd>Góquim is an agglutinative language. There are eight cases and two numbers in Góquim. All new words are made by combining existing words only.  [Nikhil Sinha]</dd>

<dd>Gweydr is a language designed specifically with the principles of Word and Paradigm Morphology in mind.  The intended result is a more morphologically realistic language.  Additionally, Gweydr has a script patterned after Mayan epigraphs (for more detail, go <a href="https://dedalvs.free.fr/gweydr/stone.html">here</a>).  [David J. Peterson]</dd>

<dd>Hänäthlîêr is a fun and easy language to learn. I have just started constructing the language, but the website has an up to date English-Hanathlier Dictionary and comprehensible Lessons to help you learn it. If you are looking for a language that you can learn quickly, this is it. Also, if you are interested in helping to create a conlang, contact me.  [Shane Hampton]</dd>

<dd>The writing system is non-linear. A piece of text can be spoken in hundreds of different ways but they all have the same meaning. The name is a phonetic rendering of the English word "untitled".  So far there is only the Babel Text but I will create a grammar and a discussion of the writing system soon.  [Aaron Ruimy]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_herati.htm">Heratï</a></dt>
<dd>Heratï uses the [noun] [adj.] principle (as in French) but also will place the [prep.] after the noun as well. Like so:    yoss    grët     de (house)  (good)   (in) [noun]   [adj.]  [prep]  [Zingjar ë Gud]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_ijupuna.htm">Iju Puna</a></dt>
<dd>Iju Puna is the smallest quasi-usable language in the world with only 16 words. It is almost actually usable because of the way the vocabulary was designed to be very broad. At this rate, I would estimate the language will become fairly usable at 30 - 40 words.  [Kevin Goodman]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_indika.htm">Indika</a></dt>
<dd>The vocabulary is basically Indo-Aryan, but the grammar is similar to that of European languages. Indika also has articles, which are not present in Indo-Aryan languages.  [Nikhil Sinha]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_indonugimian.htm">Indo-Nugimian</a></dt>
<dd>Indo-Nugimian was spoken by the aboriginal tribes of the continent of Nugimia. The word "Nugimia" comes from the aborginal phrase "kimiyo' ngu'ngimiyo'", which means "in the place of the people." The language allowed for free word order, as the subject and object were fully declined. Indo-Nugimians were able to create related words using basic roots and four grammatical genders: masculine, feminine, base vitality, and inverse vitality. For example, the words for "man," "woman," "person," and "dead person" were "ngu'ngiw," "ngu'ngiye," "ngu'ngi," and "ngu'ngin," respectively. Other interesting extensions of this system included the words for "land" and "landslide" ("diso't," "diso'tin"), "water" and "flood" ("nu'tsuk," "nu'tsukin"), and "sky" and "bad weather" ("tlo'nge," "tlo'ngen"). A rich set of verb aspects also allowed them to express compactly many different flavors in continuity, certainty, and necessity of action, for example, "He would have gone (by now)" was simply "Diyazhile," and "I need to go" was simply "Diyatus."

<dd>Jleer uses an abugida / syllabary with only 49 symbols (including punctuation; numbers; and the obsolete tone system) and denotes 4 accent / word-combining / tone runes; 16 numbers; and 4224 possible syllables. Also it's a three-page language with grammar, a dictionary, etc.</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_jynmu.htm">Jynmû</a></dt>
<dd>Jynmû is a language based off of the language of Mû, which was created with almost no influence of other languages. It is foreign enough to work in a fantasy setting and has enough words to hold a normal conversation.  [Justin Spahr-Summers]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_kamakawi.htm">Kamakawi</a></dt>
<dd>First off, it's got its main roots in Polynesian, which isn't something I've encountered before (though I'm sure if I looked hard enough, I probably could).  The use of markers to state the status of the subject (whether it's the same as the previous sentence, brand new, or from somewhere other than the subject position in the previous sentence) is also pretty rare, though I've done it before, and I've seen it in a natural language.  It also uses idiomatic, mandatory adverbs for many intransitive verbs, such as the sentence "I picked him up" where you can't say the verb is "to pick" but rather "to pick up".  Other than that, the language was designed specifically to be fun.  :)  [David J. Peterson]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_kelenala.htm">Kelenala</a></dt>
<dd>Kelenala is what I call a "speed creole".  I drafted a list of about 400 "basic" words (with no grammar), made up phonologically reduced forms for them, and, using these words, and <i>only</i> these words, I've created a language.  As such, it models what might happen if I were dropped into the middle of a jungle and had to form a pidgin based on the data I received.  (Well, that is, if I didn't actually bother to <i>learn</i> the language...)  [David J. Peterson]</dd>

<dd>Kirda-han is a very interesting language. A unique characteristic is that the pronouns are added as a prefix to verbs. The word order is OSV or, as my friends say, "Yoda-Talk." Like Hanathlier, Kirda-han is a simple language to learn, which is always a primary focus when I start a conlang.  [Shane Hampton]</dd>

<dd>Kótèsä is my third attempt at creating a usable language that is relatively specific while still attempting to be somewhat easy to learn and speak. Most of the words were made with no roots of other languages, though some have influences of past conlangs. Accents are used only to indicate pronunciation in this language, and are not necessary in common type.  [Justin Spahr-Summers]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_kushan.htm">Kushan</a></dt>
<dd>Case is not just indicated by an ending, but also by an adjective or article.  Kushan also uses /f/ as a semivowel, yielding words such as <i>fta</i>, "to rain".  All verbs are regular, and the word order is rather free.  [Rob H.]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_lacue.htm">Lacue</a></dt>
<dd>Laquish is to a certain degree very compact, and many have also said it sounds very nice (every conlanger's dream). It has few or no irregularities and is mostly agglutinative.

<dt><a href="mdl_megdevi.htm">Megdevi</a></dt>
<dd>Megdevi is a language I created to actually be spoken between my girlfriend and I.  When I came to the realization that she wasn't going to learn it, I expanded it on my own.  It's something of a mix between Arabic and Esperanto, seeing as it works with triconsonantal roots, but is shamelessly regular.  This was my first attempt at language creation, and thus, the idea of naturalness hadn't yet entered my skull. All the words are roughly written in SAMPA.  /a/ should be regarded as schwa-like, affricates as a single phoneme, /&/ a low, front, unrounded vowel, and /L/ as a regular [l] (I'm writing it as a capital in order to distinguish it from capital "i", [I], which is a high, front, unrounded lax vowel).  [David J. Peterson]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_melindaran.htm">Melindaran</a></dt>
<dd>Most of it is <i>a priori</i> so far. There are no special letters and the grammar is a balance of simple, regular, agglutinative, and irregular. I'm trying to make it easy to speak and still sound natural. OK, it's probably not unique.  [Randal L. Lanning]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_njaama.htm">Njaama</a></dt>
<dd>A click language, Njaama also has a pitch-accent system, and makes liberal use of adjuncts.  Also, in the Njaama script, I've come up with a method for marking tone that I think is rather unique.  There are four possible tone patterns: H, L, HL and LH.  So what I did was make four symbols that correspond to each of the above, and I prepose each word with one of those symbols, depending on its tonal pattern.  For words of multiple syllables and either a HL or LH tone pattern, I made a character to insert before the syllable where the tone changes.  [David J. Peterson]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_palakalloejna.htm">Pala-kalloejna</a></dt>
<dd>The language pala-kalloejna's lexicon, once it has been generated, will consist of a set of names in a non- or super-hierarchical namespace (a web), with names (nodes) fuzzily linked to other names. Any name can have any number of links to any other names. The form the pattern takes will be malleable - indeed, every expression in pala-kalloejna will reshape the web - and will in itself define the names (i.e., describe usage patterns for the lexemes). Contrast with a hierarchical namespace like that of Roxhai.  [Christopher Reid Palmer]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_regelluga.htm">Regelluga</a></dt>
<dd>On the surface, it has the look of a blatant Euroclone. But wait! Only a few roots actually derive from European tongues; it is the structure that you recognize.

<dt><a href="mdl_renim.htm">Reñim</a></dt>
<dd>Most words are derived from a basic root which also serves as a verb infinitive and which when agglutinated forms the different word classes. The only gender is an impersonal <i>it</i> and all nouns are plural, consisting of three states: past, present and future. Certain nouns have dual forms, such as "double", "couple", "two", and "god." Vowels can never begin a syllable, and stress is on the second and fourth syllables of a word. There are currently over 500 words.  [Martin F.]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_rigaviesutanio.htm">Rigavie Sutanio</a></dt>

<dt><a href="mdl_sinnish.htm">Sinnish</a></dt>
<dd>Sinnish is a mostly inflected language, without a 'to be' verb and with a loose structure for the "verbing" of nouns and the "nouning" of verbs. Describing nouns is done almost entirely with participles. The lexicon uses mostly compound words and will have a diverse number of terms for describing elements of a number of alternative-sexuality subcultures. It also has a number of alphabets with others planned. It is designed as a personal language and as a language for an RPG background.  [Scott 'Blade' Hamilton]</dd>

Shifting the position of the predicate in the sentence results in differentiating between the present and past tense, and the future and conditional tense. For example, I see you in Talhata is "vusaat sii" while I saw you is "sii vusaat".  [David Stewart-Candy]</dd>

<dd>Toki Pona is a cute, pidgin-like language that naturally reduces ideas to their most simple and universal meanings. The entire language has only 14 sounds and 118 words. Though not able to discuss topics such as politics or rocket science without some loss of meaning, Toki Pona functions extremely well as a conversational and thought-provoking tool.

<dt><a href="mdl_triparik.htm">Triparik</a></dt>
<dd>Triparik (or Triparian) is the language of a micronation, an artificial country, and as such is a group effort. Most of the root words are from Romance and Germanic languages, though Celtic tongues may end up contributing vocabulary. Designed to be fun but useful, the initial joke was that Triparian was "what Roman centurions used to chat up Gaulish barmaids." The web site features a thousand-word dictionary, a grammar, sample texts and the start of a primer.  [Carrie Schutrick, J.W. Justice, Shawn Knight]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_tukbeyo.htm">Tukbeyo</a></dt>
<dd>It is written again out of respect for an extinct tribe From the Newfoundland area called the Beothuks. Tukbeyo is pronounced /tuck-bay-oh/.  [Dtsdesign]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_tunu.htm">Tunu</a></dt>
<dd>A most minimalistic combination of a 14-phonemes' phonology, a CVCV lexicon, an exception-free grammar and self-segregating word boundaries.  [Mathias]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_tylsjok.htm">Tyl Sjok</a></dt>
<dd>Tyl Sjok has only one open class of words.  These words can be regarded as verbs or nouns (and sometimes adjectives); however, they are not specified or understood to have a fixed function.  Only translation introduces this distinction.  The only grammar rule that combines the words is 'control'.  Particles exist for clarifying the sentence structure, but they are all optional.  This creates a very simple but extremely ambiguous language that will be a basis for derived languages.  [Henrik Theiling]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_tymat.htm">Tymat</a></dt>
<dd>Tymat features heavy agglutination on verbs, to show tense, aspect, subject and object of the verb, among other things. This can produce very long words, such as <i>Nokasapêkomerongalola</i>, which means "Will you not have been eating it?" Syllable order is usually CV, although a little variation is allowed.  [Shane Hodgson]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_unkyok.htm">Un'ky'ok</a></dt>
<dd>It is a language of many accents and very descriptive words.  It has 3 tenses: perfect, imperfect, and present perfect. It has only 3 declensions: masculine, feminine, and neuter.  [Jordan Lavender]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_uqoi.htm">Üqoi</a></dt>
<dd>Üqoi is being developed for an alien race, Zhoo'oonaiï, protagonists of a possible science fiction novel.  The descriptive paradigms. When one wishes to express an emotional or other state, such as <i>Motuulh dhnuuvai</i>, "I am sad", the literal translation is "Sadness I am." Rarely, one might say <i>Mozütuulh dhnuuvai</i>, "sadness(passive voice) I am". Also, one would say <i>thoineej dhuuvai</i>, "it is burned", lit., "fire it is". Also, there is no direct translation of "it", "him", "her" or "them". To say "Talk to her", you would say <i>Zhoonampej'ei aüqoi</i> ("To herself speak"). Adjectival and possessive forms, numerical system.  [Bruce V. Bracken]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_utesalane.htm">Utésalañé</a></dt>
<dd>Utsalañé is based on Uelane, another one of my languages; it was supposed to lose the cases of the earlier languages, to make it simpler.  It also was my first 'modern' tongue.  [Jordan Lavender]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_vabungula.htm">Vabungula</a></dt>
<dd>Vabungula has over 5500 words.  [Bill Price]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_vaior.htm">Vaior</a></dt>
<dd>Vaior represents the merging of classical Greek grammar (simplified) and Inuktitut derivational processes (again, simplified in some ways, expanded in others) run through Quenya-like phonotactics.  The result is the most coherent and beautiful language I've ever created.  [William S. Annis]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_vendi.htm">Vendi</a></dt>
<dd>The site offers a primer, a grammer, sample texts, its own script, and a dictionary of over 400 words.  [Chris Ashton]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_vixen.htm">Vixen</a></dt>
<dd>Apart from a few English loanwords and certain other features, Vixen's vocabulary has been created entirely by me. The grammar and sound systems are reasonably similar to English, although work in recent times has helped make it less Indo-European. For various reasons, standard Vixen has a verb system which is entirely regular apart from the unpredictability of passive forms, although certain other features (notably spelling) are somewhat erratic.  [Curlyjimsam]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_voida.htm">Voidä</a></dt>
<dd>The language has an interesting way of using direct objects.  All noun cases can be changed not only by number and declination, but also by direct objects.  Other features include a large number of cases, restriction of standalone pronouns, alternative verb forms and a somewhat complicated adjective system.  [Kaspars Ozolins]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_vonana.htm">Vônánà</a></dt>
<dd>Vônánà has many more vowels (24) than consonants (12). It makes much use of diacritics in order to show the different vowel sounds. Vônánà was created as an experiment to see how such a language would look and sound. It contrasts with 'Lt'r, its 'sister conlang' (in that the two were created together), which has many consonants but very few vowels.  [Curlyjimsam]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_vong.htm">Vong</a></dt>
<dd>Vong is a tonal language with three tones:  rising, falling, and even.  [Victor Medrano]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_xail.htm">Xail</a></dt>
<dd>Xail sounds pleasant and has eight vowels. Grammar is described logically.  [Sampo Taito Louke]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_xara.htm">Xara</a></dt>
<dd>Xara is designed to be a personal and creative means of communication. It has a precise but flexible grammar and syntax and a unique vocabulary.  [Jim Taylor]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_yahina.htm">Yahina</a></dt>
<dd>It is to show respect for the last Yana-yahi Indian found in California; his name was Ishi and his story is cool and sad at the same time. I am going to do a lot with this language. There is possibly a small dictionary on Yana-yahi but I have not seen it; it was done in 1912.  [Dtsdesign]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_yeledumelthanusil.htm">Yeledumel Thanusil</a></dt>
<dd>Rythmic and sounds pleasant  [Eric Anger]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_yfrgalin.htm">Yf Rgalin</a></dt>
<dd>Inspired by Lojban and Klingon, Yf Rgalin was developed to explore some features that were "amusing" to the author, while maintaining simplicity and regularity. It's a verb-first ergative language, with some attempt at Lojban-like regularity (but without quite so much rigor). There's some attempt to derive everything from verbs (except nouns). The phonology is slightly unusual; its sentence structure may be unique, as well as its verb structure (inspired by a feature in Basque).  [Mark E. Shoulson]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_yirril.htm">Y-irril</a></dt>
<dd>[Jeremy Marshall]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_ypsilonsk.htm">Ypsìlònsk</a></dt>
<dd>Ypsìlònsk has 16 special characters taken from languages from all over the world. I tried to keep its grammar as simple as possible, but I don't know if I succeeded everywhere. The syntax is mainly based on German, also the cases are, but there are a few differences. Well, have a look yourself; you will see!  [Yulyan Ròt]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_ytady.htm">Ýtádý</a></dt>
<dd>This language was derived out of my own frustrations with dyslexia and the English language. What is distinctive about this language is the thirteen different vowel sounds that never change, ensuring (along with a few other rules) that you can never pronounce or read this language incorrectly.  [Ren Willocks]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_zegzolt.htm">Zegzolt</a></dt>
<dd>[Toni Keskitalo]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_zelknaym.htm">Zelknaym</a></dt>
<dd>It is another of my tributes to an extinct tribe; this one to a tribe in Southern Chile called the Selk'nams.  Circa 1994, there were only two little old ladies left...probably gone now.  I followed the few known words I could find and designed from there...enjoy!  [Dtsdesign]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_zengo.htm">Zengo</a></dt>
<dd>Zengo is a language that allows Harrison to indulge his interest in words with five letters. The small vocabulary contains an eclectic mix of such words from different languages. Zengo was formerly called Penta (until Intel made him change the name :-).  [Rick Harrison]</dd>

<dt><a href="mdl_zhyler.htm">Zhyler</a></dt>
<dd>Zhyler features 57 noun cases, in part due to a diachronic change where all postpositions in the language fused onto the nouns they modified, at which point a vowel harmony system came into being.  Zhyler also has 17 noun classes, not unlike those found in the Bantu language family.  [David J. Peterson]</dd>
