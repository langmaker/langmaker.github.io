<p><a href="alp_pagmitlang.htm">Pagmitlang</a> - Pagmitlang is taken from the Hiligaynon language and means "Pronunciation", which I found fitting as Pagmitlang reflects my pronunciation of English. It is a pure alphabet with both capital and lowercase letters. While it is meant to give my pronunciation of English, it is not meant to give an exact pronunciation, but to give an idea of my pronunciation of English. Punctuation is the same as in English, and the only two special diacritics used are the acute accent (used only when necessary), and a superscript dot, which is used on vowels to indicate Hiatus, or in words where it would be ambiguous, to indicate a glottal stop follows the vowel marked with the superscript dot.</p>
<p><a href="alp_patoukii.htm">Patoukii</a> - Patoukii is a true alphabet with a rather unusual distribution of its sounds - 12 consonants and 33 vowels (because of tones).</p>
<p><a href="alp_pekrif.htm">Pékrif</a> - Pékrif - literally "collection of marks" - is the official alphabet of the Republic of Ånhrush and is used chiefly to write its official language, Gomain (elsewhere on this site). Most of its letters have independent, initial, medial, and final forms, formed from a core element and two (usually) symmetrical end elements.</p>
<p><a href="alp_petersonianenglishalp.htm">Petersonian English Alphabet</a> - I, like nearly everyone else, have my own ideas for how English should reform its spelling system.  I'm not pushing it as a real reform (I wouldn't be so audacious as to call it after myself if it were), but I like it and use it.  These were my main goals in creating the spelling system, and the ideas I had to go along with it:<ul><li>I thought a good reform would use only the letters used in English currently, sans diacritics, in as recognizable and as regular a fashion as possible.</li><li>I imagined that if a spelling reform were to take place, spelling would <i>have</i> to be destandardized, so that each region/dialect could spell the language the way they saw fit.  In order to comply with this ideal, I tried to make a letter or letter combination for each phoneme that exists in the English's of the world, regardless of whether any one dialect would use them all. </li><li>I was on a mission to destroy the letter "k".</li></ul><p>Beyond that, the system above should be fairly self-explanatory.  A couple more notes:<ul><li>Since there are some dialects that, for example, pronounce the words <i>writer</i> and <i>rider</i> differently, I've preserved a medial distinction between "t" and "d".  The idea would be that any dialect could use whichever letter intervocalically that they wanted.</li><li>Same story for "th" and "dh".</li><li>A sticky issue that many trying to use the Roman alphabet with other languages have had to grapple with is the distinction between angma and angma+g.  I resolved in the ugliest fashion possible, using "ng" and "ngg", but keeping "nc" rather than "ngc".  Though the two sounds do contrast (e.g., "anger" vs. "hanger" [British pronunciation]), one solution might be to ignore the contrast, as is currently done, and spell both as "ng".</li><li>An unresolved issue is the following: When you take stuff from a store when the owners aren't around, particularly because some emergency or other is occurring, you are <i>looting</i>.  A new dietary supplement that many multi-vitamins now claim to have traces of is called <i>lutein</i>.  In some dialects, these two words contrast only by one sound: A flap vs. an aspirated "t" (this is the dialect(s) where the "-ing" ending has come to be pronounced [-in]).  I have no solution to this problem.</li></ul></p>
<p><a href="alp_pmf.htm">PMF</a> - The PMF script for English is designed for speed writing and easy recall.  Monoline means that the pen does not have to be lifted from the page to draw a letter form.  The sound sign shapes are associated with common objects which begin with the same sound.  There are similar shapes for similar sounds.</p>
<p><a href="alp_pokhi.htm">Pokhi</a> - This is an abugida with complex glyphs, which are "scientifically" built:  there is a base glyph for each articulation place to which the various manners are added as extra lines or hooks, then to the completed consonant the intended vowel is superimposed. The script may also be used as an alphabet, by adding the vowels to a special carrier symbol. In this case, the consonants are in their "a" forms.</p>
<p><a href="alp_portmurian.htm">Portmurian</a></p>
<p><a href="alp_protoloudanian.htm">Proto-Loudanian</a> - The Mathasian country Loudan originated as a mis-hearing of the name of the old Chinese country Loulan, which was located near the wandering lake, Lopnor.</p>
<p><a href="alp_protominhyan.htm">Proto-Minhyan</a> - Designed for inscribing in stone.</p>
