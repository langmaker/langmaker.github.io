For the past two years activity on my site has demonstrated that <a href="/db/mdl_quenya.htm">Quenya</a> is <a href="/db/mdl_pop100_2004.htm">more popular here</a>.  Yet as I say on my <a href="/top10.htm">Top 10 Conlangs</a> listing, Esperanto has "more staying power, more longevity, more speakers, more imitators than any other constructed language."  No, I don't speak Esperanto, but I continue to find it to be an astounding achievement in language construction.<br><br>What?  You're afraid of Esperanto?  My wife certainly is.  This fear is common, and you should read <a href="https://esperantic.org/ced/psyres.htm">Psychological Reactions to Esperanto</a> to better understand why.</font></div><br><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#006699" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="AskMrLanguagePerson"></a>Ask Mr. Language Person<small> - 8/19/04 - 7:52 pm</small></font><div><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Nick Kalivoda asks,<blockquote><ol><li>How can one properly put to use a "subjunctive mood," and do conjugations for this need to be created for every tense?</li><li>I have up until today unquestioningly inflected nouns after <i>saí</i> ("to be") as if they were direct objects.  I know that they are actually complements, so should I leave them in the nominative form?</li><li>My language has no consistency: it doesn't have a sound of its own, but steals from totally random ones.  One sentence may sound like French, one Finnish, one Russian, and one who-knows-what.  Is there an easy way to make all, or most, words sound as if they're part of the same language?</li><li>Is it possible to work backwards and make a proto-language after you've made its child?  It's been really, really frustrating...any suggestions?</li></ol></blockquote>Great questions, Nick.  Maybe I should start an "Ask Mr. Language Person" column, a la <a href="https://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/living/columnists/dave_barry/">Dave Barry</a>.  "The Subjunctive Mood - wouldn't that be a great name for a band?  Do passive verbs make you tense?"  OK, maybe humor's not my calling.  Some answers:<ol><li>As for the subjunctive, there are many ways to handle it.  You can express it with an adverb, to make your task much simpler.  For other ideas, suffice it to say that you should see the Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjunctive_mood">subjunctive mood</a>.</li><li> The typical choice is to leave them in the nominative form.  Do you have accusative and dative cases?  You can in fact define a number of cases and then create special exceptions.  You could say that since "to be" evolved from a verb with a different meaning that took the accusative, it still does.  After all, the verb "to be" often has irregularities that other verbs don't.</li><li>You need to create a strict phonology (system of sounds) and then create rules for mapping sounds from other languages to your phonology.  For instance, <a href="/dublexnav.htm">Dublex</a> has no /w/ sound, so words with /w/ are borrowed as /v/ instead.  Since Dublex syllables can only begin with a single consonant, initial consonant clusters experience <a href="https://langmaker.com/ml0102.htm">metathesis</a>: Latin 'class' became /kals/, Hindi /kras/ "cross" became /kars/.  By making consistent rules, you give the language its own unique flavor.  Dublex words like 'fabvocsist' ("conlang"), 'carsdev' ("Christ") and 'hazarmuh' /shahzarmoosh/ "squirrel" appeal to me, apparently.  Check out <a href="https://www.macmillandictionary.com/MED-Magazine/april2003/06-language-interference-loan-words.htm">Japanese borrowings of English</a> for a real-world case of this.</li><li> Why yes it is, and Zomp would argue that it is more fun to do <a href="https://www.zompist.com/eastern2.html#secret">proto-languages in reverse</a>!</li></ol></font></div><br><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#006699" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="PassingtheBaton"></a>Passing the Baton<small> - 8/18/04 - 7:18 pm</small></font><div><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">I decided to enroll <a href="/db/mdl_kalisise.htm">Kali-sise</a> in the latest <a href="/db/eng_translationrelay.htm">translation relay</a>, because I wanted some more sample texts in Kali-sise.  I hadn't participated in a relay since translating the Bast relay of 1999 into <a href="/db/mdl_dublex.htm">Dublex</a>.  This time around, I started the relay, being given a <a href="/db/mdl_wenedyk.htm">Wenedyk</a> text by Jan van Steenbergen.  It was great to spend some time with his unique language.<br><br>I translated the seven-sentence text in about three hours, passing it along on the relay.  Unfortunately, while I didn't think I had expanded the grammar, I really hadn't documented it in enough detail for the person who followed me.  Accordingly, based on his questions, I've now updated the <a href="/kalisisegrammar.htm">Kali-sise grammar page</a> to clarify the semantic role of cases, to describe dependent clauses, to explain the lack of prepositions and to proscribe question phrasings.  Of all my languages right now, I think Kali-sise has the most elegant grammar, simple yet expressive. Kali-sise is in some ways my answer to <a href="/db/mdl_tokipona.htm">Toki-Pona</a>.  If you think the Kali-sise grammar is too minimalist, I would contend that it is more complex than that of many pidgins.<br><br>Since it would be breaking the rules to show an excerpt from the relay (which is still in progress), I will instead share a translation I recently posted to the <a href="/db/rsc_conlang.htm">CONLANG-L</a> list:<blockquote><b><i>Ka pi sisi se nunete ke ka lele pi kune-pinise se sisi se lete luka ke.</i></b><br><font size="-1">RELATIVE-CLAUSE NOMINATIVE movement VERB mountain ACCUSATIVE RELATIVE-CLAUSE male NOMINATIVE beginning(opposite-end) VERB movement VERB little-thing rock ACCUSATIVE.</font><br>"The man who moves a mountain begins by moving small stones."</blockquote></font></div><br><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#006699" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="EloiEloi"></a>Eloi, Eloi<small> - 8/17/04 - 7:44 pm</small></font><div><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Yanifv asks, "Does anyone know how H.G. Welles' Eloi should be pronounced, and where their name comes from?"<br><br>I assume Eloi is pronounced /EE-loy/. And of course for the etymology I immediately thought of Mark 15:34:<blockquote>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "<i>Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?</i>" which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"</blockquote>If anyone has any other theories, <a href="/contact_form.htm">contact me</a>.  Also let me know of information we can use to update the <a href="/db/mdl_eloi.htm">Eloi profile</a>. Yanif writes back to say, "Thanks vey much, Jeffrey. That's also what I found, although if that's indeed the source then the 'right', 'original' pronunciation should be /e-lo-HI/ ('God' or 'Godly') in Hebrew: a strange name indeed for that race!"<br>9/4/04 - Thomas Slawson adds,<blockquote>I thought of the same thing too.  But just to point out "elohim" in Hebrew means "God" or "gods."  When Jesus cried out from the cross he said, "eloi" which is Aramaic.  "Eli" in Hebrew means "My God" and "Eloi" is the Aramaic for "My God."  I'm not sure if the correlation is intentional or not.  Given the nature of the story in which the Eloi are being hunted and eaten by the Morlochs, it could be very well possible that there is some connection, as if to say, "My God, why have you forsaken us."  Just a theory though.  It could just be that Wells liked the sound of the name.</blockquote></font></div><br><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#006699" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="ADownsideofUPSID"></a>A Downside of UPSID<small> - 8/15/04 - 10:06 am</small></font><div><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Tirtirxu writes, "I just thought of a really cool idea.
