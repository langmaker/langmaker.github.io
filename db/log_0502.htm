I started using it on the Palm III and used it through a series of Palms.  At one point, I even took handwritten notes using Graffiti, it was so ingrained into my brain.  Graffiti is even supported on Windows Mobile devices (né PocketPC), where it is called "Block Letters" (sorry, Palm, I switched to a <a href="https://www1.us.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/axim_x30_high">Dell Axim</a> last year).  To celebrate Graffiti, I created a Langmaker transliteration of it and added that graffito to the site.</font></div><br><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#006699" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="CertifiedMail"></a>Certified Mail<small> - 2/28/05 - 9:57 am</small></font><div><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Aaron Morse, editor and updater of the Resources directory, writes:<blockquote>A reminder to people <a href="/submitheadline.htm">submitting</a> or updating entries on Langmaker!

I would like to see it more purposely designed and easier to grasp the purpose of the site for a first-time viewer."</li><li>"The layout/graphics. They're pretty good but not good enough."</li><li>"The busy three-column layout and anti-eye-catching color scheme."</li><li>"The design is a bit... hmmm..."</li><li>"The layout. The update news should be on top of the page. Something should be done about these tables with the default border everywhere. More framing and more space everywhere might help too.  Navigation is tough, and sometimes the link bar on the left side of the page is covered by a graphic or ad (Though this might just be my browser playing with me)."</li><li>"Front page seems cluttered."</li></ul><i>Before we gather your demographic information, do you have any final comments on the site or this survey?</i><br><ul><li>"Keep up the good work... If you can find the time and the power, a site rehaul is long overdue."</li><li>"I forgot to put this earlier. I think you should do a new layout, if at all possible. As shown by <a href="https://websiteoptimization.com/">Websiteoptimization.com</a>, Langmaker.com takes ages to load on dialup connections, plus I don't find the design to be that appealing. When I first visited Langmaker.com, it took me a long time to figure out where I could find the conlang index, etc. It's improved a bunch, but could use some renovation."</li><li>"Please revise the site's navigational layout. It's rather hard to find things in the state it's in right now."</li><li>"There's so much info on it! It's hard to find things sometimes -- I had to really dig last week ... but I'm not sure, offhand, how I'd recommend reorganizing it."</li><li>"Navigation could be a lot easier. It's sometimes hard for me to find what I'm looking for if I go hunting for something specific."</li></ul>The new design unveiled today is an attempt to address these comments.  To clarify the navigation, I've restructured the directories and added a <a href="/more.htm">more &raquo;</a> link; every page now has a link to a "parent" page under the Langmaker logo.  I like concrete suggestions, so go take the <a href="https://survey.perseus.com/13fa0b99.htm">survey</a>!  If you already have, you can <a href="/contact_form.htm">contact me</a> with further ideas for improving the new design.</font></div><br><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#006699" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="SearchandYeShallFind"></a>Search and Ye Shall Find<small> - 2/20/05 - 4:22 pm</small></font><div><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">In the <a href="https://survey.perseus.com/13fa0b99.htm">survey</a> I asked, "What do you most dislike about my blog/journal/site?"  Some responses:<ul><li>"The fact that finding anything in specific is nearly impossible. I love the content, but your site design needs a little work."</li><li>"It's rather hard to find things in the state it's in right now."</li><li>"Sometimes it is difficult to find a specific language on this site."</li></ul>Part of this is just the fact that there are now over 4,000 pages on the site:  it's hard to provide short, convenient paths to all of them.  For now, I have added an <a href="/search.htm">advanced search</a> capability. If you have specific ideas on how to improve site navigation, please <a href="/contact_form.htm">contact me</a>.</font></div><br><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#006699" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="UndueInfluence"></a>Undue Influence<small> - 2/19/05 - 9:20 pm</small></font><div><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">To the <a href="https://survey.perseus.com/13fa0b99.htm">survey</a> question, "What information were you hoping to find but didn't?", someone wrote, "It's difficult for me to find languages that are inspired by certain other languages. For instance, if I'm looking for English-based conlangs, it's difficult to find them without scrolling through each individual language."<br><br>That's a great point.  I've added a new index, <a href="/db/conlangbynatlangs.htm">Conlangs by Natural Language Influences</a>, to remedy this.  It doesn't list every natlang influence, just those of the most prominent natural languages (those with two-letter ISO codes).  <br><br>If anyone out there really wants it expanded to three-letter ISO codes, then they will need to do some data formatting to assist me; <a href="/contact_form.htm">contact me</a> for details.</font></div><br><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#006699" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="TileSetting"></a>Tile Setting<small> - 2/18/05 - 7:38 pm</small></font><div><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Thanks to all of you who have completed the <A href=" https://survey.perseus.com/13fa0b99.htm">Site Feedback Survey</a> -- if you haven't had a chance to take it yet, please do so now.

It was the most linguistically interesting of the five different series, with a Universal Translator that was sometimes a tool for the onboard linguist rather than a Magic Box.  I'll miss it, because next season would have been about the founding of the Federation (funny, that's what I thought the first season was supposed to lead into).

Unfortunately, I foolishly expected that if the page didn't exist its size would be returned as zero -- an error resulted instead, and new files weren't being uploaded.  I foolishly didn't test this part of the code (it worked as intended for modified files) but just went live with it.<br><br>As I said, I've been swamped.  If not for my new editorial staff (introductions to follow), we would have had no new headlines these past weeks. Anyway, the 130th post-apocalyptic rodent is happily spinning and has just uploaded 116 files that were missed.
