      <P> <SMALL>I received the following text on diskette in the mail. The author 
        wishes to remain anonymous, but if you would like to send the author a 
        message, e-mail it to me and I will relay it. - Rick Harrison (hrick@magicnet.net)</SMALL> 
      <H2>Dunia </H2>
      <H3>a world auxiliary language with a world outlook </H3>
      <P> The design of Dunia is based on the recognition that all previous proposals 
        for a world auxiliary language have either been entirely oriented towards 
        Europe and the West for their grammar and lexical material, or if they 
        did have a wider outlook in their design, they were so difficult that 
        they pleased nobody. 
      <P> Dunia draws its grammar and lexical material from the most widely spoken 
        languages throughout the world, for example: Chinese, Hindi/Urdu, Spanish/ 
        Portuguese, English, Malay/Indonesian, Arabic, Russian, Japanese and German. 
        However, it does this in such a way as to permit the learner to know in 
        advance where to expect words to come from, and in such a way that learning 
        Dunia will represent knowledge usefully learned, even if one day he or 
        she drops the language altogether. There are no words in Dunia which are 
        not derived from some existing language or other, and as far as possible, 
        within the constraints of having a logical orthographical system, they 
        appear in Dunia in the same form as they appear in the source language. 
      <P> Dunia is mostly an isolating language. This means there are few endings 
        to learn or recognise and each word usually appears in the sentence in 
        the same form as you would use to look it up in a dictionary. Chinese 
        and, to a large extent, English are examples of isolating languages. Dunia 
        lies somewhere in between Chinese and English in the extent to which it 
        is isolating. 
      <P> The fact that Dunia is an isolating language does not mean that it has 
        no grammar. There are a number of grammatical or structural words that 
        are need to carry out the purposes that endings fulfill in languages that 
        are not isolating. In Dunia, these words are taken mostly from Mandarin 
        Chinese. 
      <P> This does not mean that the student of Dunia has to cope with either 
        the complicated writing system of Chinese, or with its tones and other 
        pronunciation difficulties which learners of Chinese face. Dunia is written 
        in the Roman alphabet, with no accents and using the most widely agreed 
        values for the letters. Q and X, which do not have internationally agreed 
        values, are avoided except in personal and place names. 
      <P> Some languages have quite rigid rules about what combinations of letters 
        are permitted in a word. In Japanese, for example, each syllable must 
        end in a vowel or with an N. There are no such restrictions in Dunia, 
        although knowledge of these kinds of rules may sometimes be useful for 
        determining the etymology of a word. 
      <P> Stress is not important in Dunia, unlike Russian, where it may even 
        affect the meaning of a word sometimes. In Dunia, the first syllable of 
        a word may be lightly stressed to indicate word boundaries in the same 
        way that spaces do in written text. Intonation does not play a meaningful 
        role in Dunia sentences in the way that that it does matter in many Western 
        languages. All such information is provided by explicit words to convey 
        whether the sentence is a question (<B>ma</B>), or a suggestion (<B>ne</B>), 
        or a command (<B>ba</B>) etc., rather than an ordinary statement. Rising 
        intonation at the end of a question, and falling intonation at the end 
        of a statement may however be used. 
      <P> Normal word order in Dunia is subject-verb-object as in English and 
        Mandarin Chinese and no particles are necessary to indicate the subject 
        or the object if this order is used. However unlike English and Mandarin, 
        if an indirect object is used this must be explicitly shown by a preposition 
        like <B>gei, </B>e.g. <I>I give the person the book, </I><B>wo dar GEI 
        al homo al kitab.</B> 
      <P> If the object does not follow the verb, it is marked by the preposition 
        <B>o,</B> e.g. <I>it is curry that they are eating, </I><B>o tarkari tamen 
        komer.</B> There is a focus, or emphasis, on the word not in the normal 
        position. Note that although <B>o</B> is a postposition in the source 
        language, Japanese, Dunia always uses prepositions. Although there is 
        a word in Mandarin which would have fulfilled the same purpose (ba <SUP>3rd 
        tone</SUP>), it cannot be used because it conflicts with the word <B>ba,</B> 
        also from Mandarin (neutral tone), which we have already allocated as 
        the suggestive mood particle, and the Japanese equivalent is used instead. 
      <P> In addition to the subject-predicate sentence structure most used in 
        Western languages, Dunia also provides for a topic-comment structure with 
        the topic end being marked by <B>wa</B> (from Japanese - there is no word 
        used for this in Mandarin): <I>as for my sister, she is coming on Monday, 
        </I><B>woski soror wa, ta yao venir getsuyobi.</B> Japanese names for 
        days of the week are quite suitable for use in an international language 
        as they are not terribly culture specific. 
      <P> The use of particles is generally governed by the principles of necessity 
        and sufficiency, i.e. the number of particles used should be sufficient 
        to convey the meaning adequately, but do not have to be present if they 
        are not needed. For example <I>a/one horse,</I> <B>un ekwus,</B> but two 
        horses can simply be <B>du ekwus,</B> you do not have to say <B>du ekwus 
        men,</B> as the idea of the plurality is already conveyed by the word 
        <B>du.</B> 
      <P> There are four fundamental parts of speech in Dunia: nouns, verbs, adjectives 
        and 'everything else'. The 'everything else' category includes grammatical/structural 
        particles, modal particles, time expressions, prepositions, case and sentence 
        structure markers, conjunctions, interjections, personal and correlative 
        pronouns, articles, numerals and primitive adverbs. These are drawn mostly 
        from the Chinese, Japanese, Malay/Indonesian, Arabic and Russian languages. 
      <P> Primitive adverbs are those where the basic idea is that of modifying 
        an action or a quality, and other words are formed from that adverb only 
        as a derivation of that basic adverbial idea. In Dunia such words are 
        taken from Russian: e.g. <B>chasto</B> (often), <B>ochen</B> (very), <B>tolko</B> 
        (only), <B>mnogo</B> (much), <B>konechno</B> (of course). 
      <P> Conjunctions are words which can be used to join clauses or sometimes 
        individual words. In Dunia such words are taken from Malay/Indonesian: 
        <B>dan</B> (and), <B>atau</B> (or), <B>tetapi</B> (but), <B>meskipun</B> 
        (although), <B>agar</B> (so that). Run on clauses, where there is no link 
        word are a common feature of Chinese. However, where sentences following 
        this construction method might be difficult to analyse, a conjunction 
        such as <B>dan,</B> or the end of topic marker <B>wa</B> should be added 
        in Dunia. 
      <P> Many common nouns are drawn from English, but where many derivatives 
        of the root idea use the Latin root in English instead, Dunia does this 
        too. For example <I>tooth </I>is <B>dent</B> because the English for 'dentist' 
        is <I>dentist </I>and so on. For international scientific vocabulary, 
        particularly flora, fauna, parts of the body and medical conditions, the 
        Latin word is used. 
      <P> Verbs are drawn mostly from Spanish, with some adjustments for spelling, 
        e.g. <B>rekordar</B> (remember), <B>deskansar</B> (rest), <B>korer</B> 
        (run), <B>cerar, </B>pron. /tserar/ (shut), <B>lyegar</B> (arrive) and 
        so on. Verbs in Dunia are invariable for person and number. Various particles 
        (from Mandarin) are available to show tense, aspect and voice where this 
        is relevant. Verbal particles include <B>gou</B> and <B>yao</B> to show 
        past and future tense if this is not obvious from the context, <B>le</B> 
        and <B>zhe</B> to show completed and continuous aspect and <B>shou</B> 
        and <B>cheng</B> to show passive and medial voice. <B>Cheng</B> is used 
        also as a predicative particle: <B>women gou eskoger ta cheng president,</B> 
        <I>we chose him/her as president. </I>Note that verbal particles always 
        precede the verb in Dunia, although some of them do not do so in Chinese. 
        If necessary, participial adjectives can be formed from verbs if required, 
        but these should not be used in a verbal context. These are -ando and 
        -ido respectively for active and passive, replacing the verb infinitive 
        ending -ar, -er or -ir. 
      <P> Nouns can be turned into a verb meaning to use the noun in the most 
        usual way by the particle <B>da: wo da kitab,</B> <I>I read,</I> <B>nu 
        da jidosha,</B> <I>she drives. </I>For any derivation about which there 
        could be any doubt, use a more conventional verb expression. 
      <P> Similarly adjectives are drawn mostly from Hindi/Urdu: <B>tanda</B> 
        (cold), <B>safed</B> (white), <B>jaldi</B> (early), <B>kubsurat</B> (beautiful), 
        <B>bahadur</B> (brave), etc. The decision on which of these three categories 
        the root idea actually belongs to may be a slightly arbitrary one in a 
        few cases, so there is no need to be too rigid about it. The normal order 
        is for adjectives to precede the noun they qualify. To convert nouns into 
        adjectives, the ending <B>-ski</B> is used. For the basic root adjectives 
        from Hindi this ending is not needed, and if used imparts a nuance of 
        -ish: <B>un safed jidosha,</B> a white car, <B>un safedski jidosha,</B> 
        a whitish car. The comparative and superlative forms of adjectives can 
        be formed by use of the adverbs <B>bolshe</B> (more), <B>menshe</B> (less) 
        and <B>samo</B> (most) etc.: <B>Berlin estar bolshe bara bi Hamburg</B> 
        (Berlin is bigger than Hamburg), <B>Madrid estar al samo bara urb li Espanya</B> 
        (Madrid is the biggest city in Spain). An alternative construction is 
        modelled on Chinese: <B>Somer bi winter garam</B> (summer is hotter than 
        winter), <B>Esperanto bu gen Volapuk buda</B> (E is not as old as V), 
        <B>Dunia bi minadono al acha lingua</B> (Dunia is the best language of 
        all). 
      <P> Adjectives can be used as a predicative verb: <B>al dor lal</B> the 
        door is red. Often it is not necessary to mark adjectives as adverbs when 
        the are used to modify actions: <B>al tren viajar tez</B> the train travels 
        fast. If it is necessary to show adverbial use of an adjective, either 
        add <B>-sko</B> or if it already ends in <B>-ski,</B> change this to <B>-sko.</B> 
        To make adverbs out of words other than adverbs, precede them with the 
        particle <B>shang.</B> This word can also be used as an indefinite preposition, 
        like <I>je </I>in Esperanto: <B>shang nokt ta gou lyegar,</B> he/she arrived 
        during/in the night. Opposites of adjectives may be formed by the particle 
        <B>yang.</B> However, ANY adjective may be borrowed from Hindi/Urdu: <I>dry 
        </I>may be translated as either <B>suka</B> or <B>yang gila,</B> and <B>gila</B> 
        or <B>yang suka</B> is <I>wet. </I>Note, of course, that <B>bu suka</B> 
        is not the same as <B>yang suka.</B> The Hindi prefixes <B>kush-</B> and 
        <B>bad-</B> may also be used where appropriate: <B>kushbudar</B> sweet-smelling 
        and <B>badbudar</B> foul-smelling. 
      <P> However, words which are already in international usage constitute legitimate 
        Dunia vocabulary irrespective of their origin and are to be preferred 
        over any equivalents from a single language, or over Dunia words autonomously 
        created by the rules of word formation. Examining the vocabularies of 
        certain languages, such as for example Hungarian, is a good way of detecting 
        words which have received a sufficiently level of international currency, 
        but we should beware of looking only at European languages and of believing 
        that it is only Western words which are capable of achieving a wide currency. 
        A number of words from Arabic, for example, have been borrowed into a 
        wide range of languages as diverse as Hausa, Swahili, Turkish, Hindi and 
        Indonesian. Such words form a part of Dunia vocabulary as well. <B>Dunia</B> 
        (world) is itself such a word, as is <B>kitab</B> (book) and <B>kalam</B> 
        (writing implement). Where a word is particularly associated with a particular 
        place or language, there is room in Dunia for a LIMITED number of these: 
        these might include <B>kuaizi</B> (chopsticks) from Chinese, <B>zeit</B> 
        (oil) from Arabic, <B>jidosha</B> (automobile) from Japanese, <B>konyak</B> 
        from French, and <B>kanikchak</B> (snow) from Inuit. 
      <P> All words should be incorporated into Dunia by means of a trade off 
        between spelling and pronunciation. This applies to placenames as well, 
        and the local word should be the one which is used in Dunia. However, 
        as the orthography used may well not be compatible with that of Dunia, 
        and because Dunia cannot represent all sounds in all languages, and because 
        the written form may be an important recognition cue, some compromise 
        is in order. For example Germany might be <B>Deutshland,</B> pronounced 
        /deutSland/, rather than *Doichlant or *Deutschland. 
      <P> The personal pronouns in Dunia are: <B>wo, ni,</B> and <B>ta</B> for 
        1st, 2nd and 3rd persons respectively. If it is required to show the plural, 
        <B>-men</B> can be added. If it is required to show sex in the third person, 
        the particles <B>nan</B> and <B>nu,</B> also used to show sex in word 
        formation, can be used instead. <B>Yi</B> can be used as an impersonal 
        pronoun if required. <B>Ji</B> is the reflexive pronoun, normally used 
        to distinguish whether the object in the third person refers to the subject 
        or not, as in many Western languages. In the 1st and 2nd persons <B>ji</B> 
        may be used, or the normal subject pronouns. To express the reflexive 
        in the sense of each other, the word is <B>mei.</B> If it is desired to 
        distinguish between inclusive and exclusive we, then <B>woni</B> and <B>wota</B> 
        can be used instead of <B>women.</B> 
      <P> Compound words in Dunia are in the format modifier-headword, as in many 
        languages including English and Chinese. Such words may be joined or separated 
        by a hyphen or space. 
      <P> There are some endings which are used in Dunia for word formation and 
        these are derived from Western usage: <B>kreer,</B> to create, hence <B>kreacion</B> 
        (object and action); <B>kub</B> (cube), hence <B>kubism, kubist.</B> Where 
        a word has become current internationally, and is created by word formation 
        affixes which do not form part of the set normally used by Dunia to actively 
        form new words, this does not prevent the root from being borrowed as 
        it stands. For example the prefix <B>inter-</B> and the suffix <B>-al</B> 
        in the word <B>Internacional</B> meaning an international organisation, 
        as in <B>Rotari Internacional</B> or <B>Komunist Internacional,</B> and 
        hence the use of the word <B>internacional</B> in an adjectival sense 
        would be legitimate. However, the existence of such words would not prevent 
        the use of <B>dunia(ski)</B> or <B>zhongnacion(ski)</B> being used as 
        alternatives. 
      <P> Numerals in Dunia are derived from their western counterparts: <B>nul, 
        un, du, tri, kwar, kwin, heks, sep, ok, non, dek,</B> and then <B>cent 
        (100), mil (1000),</B> and optionally <B>wan (10 000),</B> and <B>lak 
        (100 000)</B> from Chinese and the Indian languages respectively. Numerals 
        are written one word per digit, e.g. 234 <B>ducent tridek kwar,</B> 234 
        567 <B>dulak triwan kwarmil kwincent heksdek sep</B> or <B>ducent tridek 
        kwarmil kwincent heksdek sep.</B> For numerals a million and higher, the 
        American, not the German conventions are used. Thus <B>duilion</B> = 10^9, 
        <B>trilion</B> 10^12 etc. Decimal fractions can be expressed with a dot 
        or a comma: 2.5 <B>du punkt kwin</B> or 2,5 <B>du koma kwin.</B> It would 
        be nice also to have a shorthand way of expressing scientific notation 
        and maybe hexadecimal numbers too. Ordinal numbers are formed by prefixing 
        the particle <B>di.</B> Fractions are formed by adding the word <B>fen,</B> 
        and number of times by adding the word <B>ci.</B> 
      <P> The correlatives in Dunia are mostly taken from Japanese, but with some 
        regularities imposed. These are only two demonstrative groups in Dunia 
        (this versus that), not 3 as in Japanese and Spanish (this, that and yonder). 
        The core words used to form the this and that correlatives are <B>ko</B> 
        (in this way) and <B>so</B> (in that way) respectively. The third basic 
        correlative group are the negatives, which begin with the Chinese root 
        <B>bu,</B> as Japanese negatives are a bit more complicated. The fourth 
        main group beginning with <B>do</B> (how/how?/how!)combines interrogative, 
        relative and exclamatory (for the last of these also adding the exclamatory 
        particle <B>la,</B> from Cantonese, at the end of the sentence). This 
        last group also provides the basis for all the other correlative groups 
        not mentioned so far. The basic table for these four is as follows:<BR>

      </TABLE>
      <P> If you want to say <I>whose</I> etc., you can say <B>de dono</B> etc. 
        If you want to indicate motion towards in the correlatives of place (hither, 
        thither, to nowhere, whither), these could be <B>jin koko, jin soko, jin 
        buko,</B> and <B>jin doko.</B> Similarly, motion from (hence etc.) could 
        be <B>chu koko, chu soko</B> etc. Other prepositions may be added as desired, 
        and of course the accusative marker if required by the word order: <I>how 
        much do you have? </I><B>o donokurai ni haber (ma)?</B> 
      <P> A handful of other affixes are used to form a range of additional correlatives 
        and correlative expressions: 
      <P> <B>mina-</B> (all), e.g. <B>minadotoki</B> always, <B>minadoko</B> everywhere, 
        <B>minadore</B> everything. <BR>
        <B>hoka-</B> (other), e.g. <B>hokadotoki</B> at another time, <B>hokado</B> 
        otherwise, <B>minahokadono</B> everybody else. <BR>
        <B>onaji-</B> (same), e.g. <B>onajidore</B> the same thing, <B>onajidoko</B> 
        the same place, <B>onajidoshite</B> for the same reason. <BR>
        <B>-ka</B> (some), e.g. <B>donoka</B> somebody, <B>dotokika</B> at some 
        time, <B>hokadokoka</B> some other place. <BR>
        <B>-demo</B> (any), e.g. <B>donokuraidemo</B> any amount, <B>bunodemo</B> 
        nobody at all, <B>hokadonademo</B> any other kind of. 
      <P> Formal expressions whose function is primarily pragmatic are taken from 
        Arabic: <B>salam</B> (hello), <B>kudahafiz</B> (goodbye), <B>merhaba</B> 
        (welcome), <B>minfadlak</B> (please), <B>asif</B> (sorry), <B>shukran</B> 
        (thanks), etc. 
      <P> There are no respect forms in Dunia such as e.g. certain Western languages 
        have for the word <I>you,</I> or that Japanese and Korean have of certain 
        nouns and verbs as well. However the word <B>san</B> (from Japanese) may 
        be useful for marking personal names when placed after them. For place 
        names, words like <B>urb, river, land, lingua</B> etc. can be placed after 
        proper names if there is any danger of the sentence being misunderstood, 
        for example if there is a clash between a proper name and a normal Dunia 
        word. 
      <P> There are a few simple rules for borrowing words from Mandarin. Basically 
        the Pinyin spelling is conserved, rather than the pronunciation. Tones 
        are ignored. If a word with a particular spelling has already been borrowed, 
        then it cannot be borrowed for another meaning even if it has another 
        tone. Words with Q and X cannot be borrowed from Mandarin because there 
        is no suitable way of indicating their spelling in Dunia orthography. 
        &uuml; is borrowed as if it was U. If a C is preceded by an A, O or U, 
        it is respelled TS, e.g. <B>tsong</B> (from). Only single syllable words 
        are borrowed from Mandarin for easy recognition of the source language. 
        Words are pronounced according to Dunia orthography, not Mandarin. 
      <P> For borrowing from Japanese, the Hepburn romanisation system is used, 
        as this corresponds well to the internationally common values for the 
        letters. 
      <P> For Spanish words there are a number of changes to the orthography. 
        Spelling is usually preserved rather than pronunciation, except that doubled 
        consonants are rewritten as singles, except for LL which becomes LY. &ntilde; 
        becomes NY and C before A, O or U becomes K. X is always respelled as 
        KS and QU as KW. These rules also apply to Latin borrowings, except LL, 
        which becomes L, and C which always becomes K. 
      <P> No standards for transliteration from Arabic or Hindi have been decided 
        on yet. 
      <P> Borrowing words from English presents a number of difficulties. These 
        include the inconsistencies in spelling and the large number of vowels 
        (12), which have to be mapped on the 5 in Dunia. If borrowing from English 
        were unrestricted, this might result in significantly more homonymy than 
        exists even in standard English. The other difficulty is the TH spelling; 
        it does not have an adequate alternative in Dunia which would allow for 
        easy recognition of words borrowed. 
      <P> To illustrate how English words might be handled, let us take for example 
        the words <I>thorn, tooth, day</I> and <I>fun.</I> These are all normal 
        basic noun ideas and might be expected to be borrowed from English all 
        other things being equal. For <I>thorn,</I> the answer is to borrow <B>dorn</B> 
        from German. For <I>tooth,</I> because its derivatives use the root <B>dent,</B> 
        we should use that instead anyway. For <I>day,</I> we can borrow <B>tag</B> 
        from German again, which also has the advantage of ending in a consonant 
        for easy recognition of the source language, and does not clash with the 
        important structural word <B>de.</B> For <I>fun,</I> there is a problem 
        transcribing the sound of the English <I>u </I>in this word. It cannot 
        be transcribed <B>fan,</B> because this would clash with <B>fan</B> (fan). 
        *Fun would not be an easily recognisable because of the very different 
        pronunciation. Perhaps an answer might be to use a root like <B>amuz</B> 
        or <B>komik,</B> which would also deal with the inherent polysemy of the 
        word <I>fun </I>in English. 
      <P> Many things have changed in the world since 1887 and this includes people's 
        views on parity of esteem of different cultures, the nature of language, 
        and the role of women, as well as the existence of values for many letters 
        of the Latin alphabet which are agreed to a large extent in international 
        place and trade names and for use in newly alphabetised languages. For 
        historical and practical reasons, Esperanto cannot easily evolve to take 
        these new attitudes and realities on board in the way it ought to, and 
        if Esperanto had been developed today it would be different from both 
        the language proposed in 1887 and the language it has evolved into today 
        as a result of extensive use. 
      <P> Having said that, the central lesson of all the centuries of constructed 
        language projects is the success of Esperanto over all other competitors. 
        Some may regret this, but it is a fact, and even if Esperanto has not 
        achieved the success that the idea of an international auxiliary language 
        ought to have, that success is still a fact. It must have done a lot of 
        things right. In over 100 years of use, many issues and ideas about how 
        a constructed language ought to work have been experimented with in Esperanto. 
        Many problems were fixed over the years, and others still remain because 
        the changes required are too great or they conflict with the <I>netushebleco 
        </I>of the Fundamento. 
      <P> Another important principle of Dunia is that its grammar should not 
        be prescriptive. The rules should be seen as models of what is allowed, 
        and not imply that everything else is forbidden. 
      <P> The model Dunia should adopt is analogous to the modern software development 
        model, with properly researched and tested releases. Upgrade versions 
        should fix bugs, and have as much backward compatibility as possible, 
        but come out infrequently enough to make sure that people upgrade when 
        the time comes. 
      <P> However, Dunia is only a draft project at its present stage of development. 
        Comments and suggestions are welcome, as are offers of collaboration from 
        those who agree with the basic aims and principles behind it. Dunia may 
        never compete with Esperanto. It may never even leave the drawing board. 
        But it is worth looking into the idea of developing an international auxiliary 
        which is both modern and worldwide in its basis and outlook.
