      <H1>Ro </H1>
      <P> <I>by Rick Harrison</I> 
      <P> Ro was an <I>a priori </I>'philosophical language,' meaning you can 
        guess what category of meaning a word falls into merely by looking at 
        the first letters. For example, <B>bofoc</B> means red, <B>bofod</B> means 
        orange, and <B>bofof</B> means yellow. It was created by the Reverend 
        Edward Powell Foster (1853-1937). 
      <P> &quot;Ro did not begin with attempting to rival or supplant any other 
        language whatever, either natural or artificial, nor was it suggested 
        by any of them,&quot; Foster wrote. &quot;Unexpectedly came the thought: 
        `How strange it is that there is nothing in the appearance of a written 
        or printed word that gives the slightest hint of its meaning. Why should 
        a word not be a picture? A new word, never seen before would then, like 
        a painting seen for the first time, convey at least some of the meaning 
        to the eye.'&quot; 
      <P> Foster reported being completely absorbed by the idea. &quot;That was 
        early in the year 1904. The thought had startling force. It was like the 
        sudden lifting of a curtain to reveal a world that I had never dreamed 
        was in existence. It filled me with amazement that people could rest content 
        with words purely arbitrary and in themselves utterly meaningless, when 
        they might be constructed scientifically and thus made self-interpreting. 
        It seemed plain that a language of that description would easily more 
        than double the capacity of mankind for the acquisition of knowledge. 
        The vivid impression took instant and complete possession of me, and brought 
        the quick resolution to tell to others what I had seen. 
      <P> &quot;After two years' study of the problem faint outlines of system 
        emerged from chaos and in 1906 the first Ro publication, an 8-page leaflet 
        with a few prospective Ro words, was printed. 
      <P> &quot;Soon my wife joined in the work with enthusiasm. She has a remarkable 
        linguistic gift amounting almost to absolute genius in her ability to 
        discriminate between closely allied synonyms and to select the word that 
        exactly fits the place to be filled. She has now prepared an English-Ro 
        dictionary of about 16,000 Ro words, and can turn any word that can be 
        defined from any language into a self-interpreting Ro word. We expect 
        to print her dictionary as soon as we can get the means to do so. 
      <P> &quot;...Ro adopts the alphabet that it finds ready-made, and approved 
        by centuries of use, with the existing form of letters and order of sequence. 
        They already symbolize elementary SOUNDS. Ro makes of them its ideograms. 
        That is, Ro uses them as symbols of elementary IDEAS. Grammarians have 
        already classified words into what they call 'Parts of Speech.' This is 
        but another expression for ELEMENTS OF LANGUAGE. It is doubtful if any 
        human being ever possessed a brain that was superior in intellectual power 
        to that of Aristotle. He gives as the ten categories of human thought: 
        Substance, Quantity, Quality, Relation, Place, Time, Position, Possession, 
        Action, Passivity. Ro classifies words under categories like these, using 
        consonants as symbols, for example, letting B stand for Substance or Existence, 
        C for Quantity, D for Place, G for Quality, J for Relation, etc. One of 
        the five vowels added to these initial consonants divides its general 
        signification into five classes, headed by a two-letter syllable, consonant 
        and vowel, and one of the 20 consonants (21 in fact) of the alphabet added 
        to this, gives more than 2000 three-letter syllables, Consonant, Vowel, 
        Consonant, which are the stemwords of Ro as a language. 
      <P> &quot;Besides this, Ro uses five vowels as initials, A to denote Pronouns, 
        E for verb inflections, Tense, Mood, etc., I and O for Prepositions, opposite 
        to each other in meaning, and U for Conjunctions. This gives 100 two-letter 
        syllables, Vowel and Consonant, for the frequent Particles of speech that 
        occur in almost every sentence. 
      <P> &quot;The other Parts of Speech, Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives and Adverbs, 
        that compose the bulk of every Dictionary, Ro indicates by the final vowel 
        of each word. The first vowel in Ro words belongs to the stem, and is 
        unchangeable. The last vowel A indicates Concrete Nouns; if E, Verb; if 
        I, Adverb; if O, Adjective; if U, Abstract Noun. 
      <P> &quot;If these classifications are correctly made, we shall have all 
        the words of human language grouped according to their signification, 
        exactly parallel with their alphabetic arrangement, and you can find the 
        Ro word that you may wish to use, as readily as you can find a person 
        in a city when you know the street on which he lives and the number of 
        his house. 
      <P> &quot;I have now been 24 years at this task. If I have not succeeded 
        in constructing a language that the world will adopt, I can only say that 
        my conviction is clear that Ro is on the right track, and my conscience 
        is clear that I have done the best I could.&quot;

      <P> Specimen (the Paternoster): Abze radap av el in suda, ace rokab eco 
        sugem, ace rajda ec kep, ace va eco, uz in suda asi in buba. 
      <HR>
      <H2>Ro grammar </H2>
      <P> In Foster's own words... 
      <H3>The Alphabet </H3>
      <P> Ro adopts as its alphabet the 26 letters a b c d e f g h i j k l m n 
        o p q r s t u v w x y z, in the order here given, and without accents 
        or diacritical marks. This is the Latin alphabet, with 'w' added. 
      <P> Of these letters, a e i o and u are vowels; the others, consonants. 
      <P> The vowels are pronounced as in Italian or German, or in the English 
        words far, they, pique, no, truth. They may be either long or short, but 
        each vowel should make a distinct syllable, and they should never be mixed 
        as in diphthongs or triphthongs. 
      <P> The letters b, d, f, g (hard as in get, go,) h, k, l, m, n, p, r, s 
        (sharp, as in see,) t, v, w, y and z, are pronounced as in English. 
      <P> C is a simple sound as English sh, French ch, or German sch. Ch as in 
        English 'church' is a double sound, and not used in Ro. 
      <P> Dh is a single sound as in English 'the' but is very infrequent in Ro. 
      <P> J is pronounced as in French, as 'z' in 'azure.' English 'J' is a double 
        sound. 
      <P> Q is like 'ng' in 'ringing.' It is a single sound. 
      <P> X in English is 'ks' or 'gz.' Ro permits this sound for X, but prefers 
        the Greek X, German CH or Celtic GH. 
      <P> English 'long I' as 'Y' in 'MY' is 'AY' in Ro. 
      <P> Ro uses 'th' as in English 'thick' but very seldom. 
      <H3>Accent </H3>
      <P> There is no rule of accent in Ro words other than the natural one of 
        emphasizing the distinctive syllable. Thus: 'Ag wela RADac ur RAFac?' 
        = 'Is it a boy or a girl?' 'Is he a boy or a man?' = 'Ad wela radAC ur 
        radAL?' 
      <H3>Case </H3>
      <P> In Ro the designation of case follows the example set by English. The 
        Subject or Nominative case is indicated by its position before the verb, 
        and the Accusative or Objective case by its position after the verb. The 
        Possessive or Genitive case is denoted by an 'e' following the noun or 
        pronoun, with or without an apostrophe preceding it as in the 's of the 
        English possessive. Thus: Abe radap'e radat'e rukab. 'My father's brother's 
        book.' 
      <H3>Number </H3>
      <P> The Plural number is denoted by the final Z. This is taken from the 
        English plural sign S which is usually pronounced like Z. 
      <HR>
      <P> Ro's creator did an excellent job of publicizing his language, but there 
        is little evidence that he persuaded anyone other than his wife to actually 
        use it. Foster acknowledged the many people who assisted him: &quot;One 
        of those to whom Ro is indebted is William W. Mills, President of the 
        First National Bank of Marietta, Ohio. For a number of years his generous 
        cheque has come regularly each month, enabling the authors of Ro to devote 
        their time to its construction... Vice-President Charles G. Dawes, unsolicited, 
        contributed one hundred dollars to the support of Ro. Hon. George White, 
        former Democratic national chairman, when a member of Congress, brought 
        Ro before Congress and secured mention of it in the Congressional Record, 
        and gave also financial aid. Mr. B. B. Putnam, treasurer of the Universal 
        Language Society, Mrs. Dave H. Morris, of the International Auxiliary 
        Language Association, and Dr. Melvil Dewey, whose name is known internationally 
        thru his Decimal Classification for libraries, have all contributed both 
        financially and sympathetically to the cause of Ro. The New York World 
        Almanac has for several years made mention of Ro in its 'Languages of 
        the World.' Leading journals and publications in the United States and 
        in other countries have given notices to Ro, frequently with generous 
        praise, and to more individuals than there is room to mention, Ro acknowledges 
        with gratitude its indebtedness, and hopes to reciprocate in turn by its 
        contribution to human progress and enlightenment.&quot;
