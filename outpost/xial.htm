      <H1>auxiliary language desiderata </H1>
      <P> On 29 August 1992, I (Rick Harrison) posted the first draft of my essay 
        'Guidelines for the design of an international auxiliary language' in 
        the conlang (constructed languages) mailing list. This is the discussion 
        that ensued afterwards...

      <P> As long as you're speccing a whole new project... 
      <P> For a language intended to be easy for virtually everybody to pronounce, 
        I think you really shouldn't keep 'r' and 'l' as separate consonants. 
        The distinction is not at all familiar to Japanese, and, although that's 
        only one language group, it's an important one. I'd say keep one liquid, 
        but allow either pronunciation, or, as in Japanese, any pronunciation 
        in between them.

      <P> Random thoughts. 
      <P> Everything desirable can be undesirable for others. 
      <P> Take phonology. Limiting the phonological inventory to what is as much 
        as possible acceptable to all leads to few phonemes. Limiting consonant 
        clusters leads to a (C)V language. So far so good, or so does it seem. 
        Well, let's take such a real language: Rotokas (New Guinea). Five vowels: 
        a e i o u, six consonants: g k p r t v. No consonant clusters, no closed 
        syllables. To me it is a frightful tongue-twister. 
      <P> ouokivuia ragai ibu iare avaraepa ogoevira ikauoro 
      <P> eakepa viapau rera kaakau taparevora voari 
      <P> When I try to utter those sentences (they are *real* Rotokas) my tongue 
        trips all over itself like the proverbial millipede who was asked: which 
        leg do you put forward first? 
      <P> I need consonant clusters to be comfortable, but that is unfair to those 
        whom consonant clusters make uncomfortable, and I am not sure that a compromise 
        somewhere in-between is not taking the worst of two bad worlds. Perhaps 
        a language that can be read out in different ways? Latin was such when 
        it was an international language; each nationality would pronounce Latin 
        as if its spelling followed the rules of their own languages. Not too 
        desirable a state of affairs, but... image a IAL with three vowels, a 
        e o, and consonant clusters. You're left with two good, serviceable, vowels 
        with which its consonant-shy speakers can break up clusters if they so 
        wish. Me, it's vowel clusters that make me trip, give me a spare consonant 
        please to break up those clusters -- not [h], I run out of breath easily; 
        not [x] I'd end up with a sore throat... a difficult customer.

      <P> Howdy conlangers! 
      <P> Kudos to Rick Harrison for his attempt to bring order out of chaos! 
        I certainly agree with most of the points he made, and hope that he doesn't 
        mind if I bring up a few minor disagreements and nitpicks. 
      <P> First of all, a nasal is not a continuant. This is the same mistake 
        that I made in one of my earlier essays, and someone kindly corrected 
        me. Thus, your sentence: 
      <P> &quot; A syllable may end in a vowel or a continuant consonant. &quot; 
        (Continuants are nasals, liquids, and fricatives.) 
      <P> should be corrected to read: 'A syllable may end in a vowel, a nasal 
        or a continuant consonant. (Continuants are liquids and fricatives.)' 
      <P> I disagree with your judgement against diphthongs. I might agree to 
        avoid diphthongs articulated at two very close vowel positions, as in 
        your example 'ou'. However, other diphthongs are easy to pronounce, highly 
        distinctive, extremely efficient, and very common. Thus, I would definitely 
        include diphthongs such as /wa/, /aw/, /ay/, /ya/, /oy/, /yo/, /we/, /wi/, 
        and perhaps /ew/ and /iw/ (where /w/ and /y/ are semivowels). 
      <P> I would not discard /d/ and /g/ just because of the Chinese and Koreans. 
        Even though these sounds do not exist as phonemes in those languages, 
        they DO exist as allophones, and both Chinese and Koreans seem to have 
        little difficulty learning to distinguish them from their unvoiced counterparts. 
        The only problem you may run into is in teaching Koreans /z/, since their 
        language does not voice ANY of its fricatives, even allophonically. Keep 
        in mind that, if you give every language veto power, you'll end up with 
        next to nothing. 
      <P> The essay doesn't state it explicitly, but you seem to be saying that 
        polysemy is bad. I don't see how you can avoid polysemy, as long as you 
        don't stretch meanings to the breaking point (say, by using the same word 
        with different argument structures). The only alternative to polysemy 
        will be a vocabulary that is so large that it is unlearnable, since you'll 
        need a different word for every slight shade of meaning. Besides, humans 
        use polysemy automatically, and I doubt if you could train people out 
        of the habit. Also, by barring polysemy, you implicitly bar metaphor, 
        since polysemy covers the mid-ground between literal meaning and metaphor. 
        I can't imagine any language that disallows metaphor. 
      <P> One point I feel you should have made (or should have stated more forcefully) 
        is that an IAL must be as neutral as possible. An IAL that is heavily 
        based on a few closely related natural languages (such as Esperanto, Ido, 
        Glossa, Interlingua, Novial, etc.), will be MUCH easier to learn for some 
        than for others. My personal feeling is that a credible IAL must be just 
        as easy to learn for a Chinese or an Indonesian as it is for an Arab or 
        an Italian. 
      <P> Finally, I'd like to comment a little on the discussion of allomorphy. 
        As best as I can discover, allomorphy exists in natural languages either 
        because of historical accident, phonological rules or cultural requirements. 
        For example, the English plural morphemes 's' and 'es' and Hungarian and 
        Turkish vowel harmony all show what appear to be 'irregularities', but 
        are actually based on phonological requirements. Some inflection in Arabic, 
        French and Russian show irregularities that exist for both phonological 
        and historical reasons. (English 'en' in 'oxen' is, of course, a historical 
        hangover). And culturally, the use of different morphemes with essentially 
        the same meaning are used to indicate register (i.e., relative status 
        between speaker and listener), as in Japanese and Cambodian. 
      <P> We don't see 'true' or 'unbiased' allomorphy simply because languages 
        evolve, and if two morphemes initially have the same meaning, they will 
        eventually drift apart and take on different meanings. This is a well-know 
        linguistic phenomenon, and no language can avoid it. 
      <P> Thus, I agree totally with Rick Harrison that allomorphy is definitely 
        a BAD THING, and should be avoided in any IAL. However, I'm not sure that 
        this restraint should apply to the loglans. Their main purpose, after 
        all, is to test the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis. In order to do this, they've 
        designed a language that seems to go against many linguistic universals. 
        And introducing a new form of intentional allomorphy is just another example 
        of the differences between loglans and natural languages. Thus, allomorphy 
        may be OK for a loglan even though it is undesirable for an IAL.

      <P> I believe that a compromise IS possible. First, do not allow consonant 
        clusters WITHIN a syllable - a cluster should only be allowed to straddle 
        a syllable boundary. Second, syllables should be open, or should only 
        be closed with nasals or continuants. Third, if a closing consonant is 
        not a nasal, then it should be voiced/unvoiced the same as the first consonant 
        of the next syllable. If it IS a nasal, then it should be homorganic with 
        the first consonant of the next syllable. 
      <P> Thus, syllable structure would be: 
      <PRE>

<FONT SIZE=2>     syllable ::= (C)V(V)(X)



     C = consonant

     V = vowel

     X = L or N or F

     L = liquid

     N = /n/ before /z/, /s/, /d/, /t/, /j in judge/, /ch in church/

         /m/ before /v/, /f/, /b/, /p/

         /ng in sing/ before /g/ or /k/

     F = /s/, /f/ or /sh in ship/ if the following C is unvoiced,

         otherwise /z/, /v/ or /s in vision/, respectively.

</PRE>
      <P> For those of you who are unfamiliar with basic phonology, the above 
        may appear somewhat daunting. If so, play with the combinations for a 
        while, and you'll see that they make very good sense. Basically, they 
        all reflect very simple rules of consonant harmony, most of which exist 
        in English and which speakers of English use automatically.

      <P> Re: IAL criteria 
      <P> I think Rick H. has taken another useful step forward in attempting 
        to establish a list of criteria which should be found in any ial. It's 
        easy to be skeptical about this, of course. I believe the members of IALA 
        (International Auxiliary Language Association) made the same attempt 40-60 
        years ago and I don't think much of this list even got used in Gode's 
        Interlingua, the one language that came out of this association. Well, 
        we probably know more now about languages and language than they did then. 
      <P> In general, I agree on the criteria set up by Rick H. and the additional 
        remarks made by Rick M. Here are a few more comments. 
      <P> As Rick H. proposes that only the three major word orders of transitive 
        sentences (SVO,SOV,VSO) should be allowed. This seems to ignore the fact 
        that even English and lots of other 'basically' SVO or SOV languages use 
        one or more of the other orders on occasion, eg, 'This book I liked'(OSV) 
        or German 'Dieses Buch mochte ich' (OVS). Maybe you mean that one of the 
        big three should be the 'basic' order, however that is defined. There 
        is probably a lot more to say about word order, eg, if you allow some 
        sentence types to have more than one word order, which subsets of the 
        set of all the logically possible word orders do you allow? 
      <P> On the allomorphy controversy: I'm going to side with the two Ricks. 
        Allomorphs should be avoided in a conlang. Lojbab made the interesting 
        point that we talk differently in a noisy environment than otherwise, 
        but I doubt that this is sufficient reason for recognizing specific allomorphs 
        in a conlang. If this is done, it should be based on input from various 
        languages as to what kind of allomorphs have developed naturally from 
        what kind of basic forms, but I gather that most of the designing of loglangs 
        was done by speakers of English. 
      <P> In general, we need to try to face the objections made by some linguists 
        who refuse to take an interest in conlangs, namely that this kind of work 
        is 'unscientific'. For this reason, I was glad to see the following passage 
        in one Rick's recent postings: 
      <P> 'There is evidence that this type of structure closely approaches the 
        built-in, instinctive linguistic tendencies of the human brain -- in other 
        words it approximates what is 'burned into the ROM chips' of our computers. 
        The particular phonemes and combinations which are learned relatively 
        late by children also tend to be relatively rare in the world's languages, 
        tend to be among the first sounds to disappear in aphasics, and tend to 
        be absent in glossolalia:' 
      <P> These facts, if they are such, give some scientific basis to Rick's 
        proposals. I think they probably are facts, on the whole, but Rick or 
        somebody ought to do some research (more detailed that quoting the general 
        statements made by Marina Yaguello) before implementing the associated 
        ideas in a conlang. Aren't there some graduate students out there looking 
        for a thesis topic?

      <P> Yes, indeed. But NOT in the way that Rick Harrison was talking about. 
        Using your over-broad definition, even English would be considered a tone 
        language, since all languages use tone (i.e., pitch and pitch contours) 
        for some purposes. However, only a small minority of the world's major 
        languages use tone to make PHONEMIC distinctions. This fraction does get 
        larger if you include more obscure languages (if memory serves, most tonal 
        languages seem to be in the Niger-Khordofanian family of Africa, especially 
        the Bantu languages). Also, keep in mind that many of these (especially 
        African languages) have only one or two non-neutral tones, and use them 
        for syntactic, rather than lexical distinctions. But even if you were 
        targeting your conlang at existing tone-language speakers, you would still 
        face serious problems, since different tone-languages use tones differently, 
        and knowing one system does not necessarily make it easier to master a 
        different system. 
      <P> &quot; It is *not* unconditionally true that tones 'make ... languages 
        <BR>
        &quot; difficult ... to learn'. 
      <P> I disagree with this even if you use your over-broad definition of a 
        tone language. And when you narrow down the definition to include only 
        conventional 'tone languages', you're going to have an even more difficult 
        time convincing anyone. 
      <P> I've studied both Mandarin Chinese and Vietnamese. The tonal distinctions 
        were, by far, the most difficult things that I've ever encountered in 
        my language studies. And even after I thought I had mastered the tones 
        of specific words, I constantly found myself forgetting them, and slipping 
        into the wrong tones. It ain't easy, buddy! 
      <P> Actually, this difficulty shouldn't be surprising, since the use of 
        tones to make phonemic distinctions is very foreign to the way I normally 
        speak. And language-teachers have long known that learning how to make 
        distinctions that you are not used to making is one of the most difficult 
        aspects of language-learning. 
      <P> Rick Harrison was correct - stay away from tones if you want to make 
        your IAL as easy to learn as possible!

      <P> &quot; One factor which complicates the learning of languages such as 
        French <BR>
        &quot; and German is the need to memorize the gender of every noun. The 
        IAL <BR>
        &quot; should either treat all non-living things as neuter or should entirely 
        <BR>
        &quot; discard grammatical reflection of gender. 
      <P> Gender has its uses. A good example (due to Quine): 
      <P> <I>He removed the manuscript from the briefcase and cast it into the 
        sea.</I> 
      <P> The English doesn't make clear what went into the sea. A French version, 
        however, is unmistakable: 
      <P> <I>Il retira le manuscrit de la serviette et le (la) jeta dans le mer.</I> 
      <P> 'le' means 'le manuscrit' and 'la' means 'la serviette', no ambiguity. 
        Now of course it is annoying to have to learn the gender of nouns painfully 
        one by one, but Rick chooses the hard cases German and French to make 
        his point! In Spanish, Italian, and Russian, morphology pretty nearly 
        determines gender, and the above advantage is still preserved. 
      <P> Lojban (toot, toot) has ten 'genderless' pronouns corresponding to 'he/she/it', 
        which can be used to talk about up to ten things at a time, but which 
        must be explicitly assigned to their referents. However, it is also correct 
        to use letters of the alphabet as pronouns, and then they are assumed 
        to refer to the most recent referent beginning with that letter. It would 
        therefore be accurate to say that Lojban has 17 grammatical genders: the 
        'b' gender, the 'c' gender, the 'd' gender, ..., each with its gendered 
        pronoun.

        Date: Tue, 1 Sep 92 10:03:17 EST </B> 
      <P> The variety of opinions about the desirability of tones strikes me. 
        I am for all purposes musically tone-deaf -- a misnomer, but never mind. 
        I can sing only off-key, out-of-tune, the screech of an owl is sweeter 
        music than my singing. Yet I had relatively little trouble mastering the 
        four tones of Mandarin. Why? Thinking back, I'd chalk it up to my mother 
        tongue, French, in which intonation plays a much smaller part than in 
        English. E.g.: I did it = Je l'ai fait; *I* did it = C'est moi qui l'ai 
        fait, or: Celui qui l'a fait, c'est moi, etc., etc. So that, for instance, 
        the third tone did not so strongly instinctively convey the interrogative 
        sense it does in English. 
      <P> That said, it is a pity that there is much, very probably valid, reluctance 
        towards tones. Tones are good for speech recognition, I'm told by a colleague 
        here who's into it (and consonants are bad, especially nasals and voiceless 
        stops), and speech recognition is fashionable. 
      <P> Now for 'et al', which is about clusters of vowels, or consonants. 
      <P> {CV(V)} I can cope with, it's when it becomes {(C)V(V)} that my tongue 
        and my ear lose all sense of direction. 
      <P> Of consonant clusters, I somehow feel that a stop preceded by a homorganic 
        nasal is acceptable to about everyone, provided the combination is flanked 
        by vowels on both sides, e.g. ambo, anta, etc. Next would be perhaps stop+liquid 
        with a vowel following: tra or tla, bla or bra. And close, very close 
        behind, stop+sibilant: tsa, dza, psa of pfa. 
      <P> Finally, an important piece of trivia. In 1974 I was in Lolovuevue (Lepers' 
        Island a.k.a. Omba, Aoba, or Oba, in Vanuatu). There, 'Jacques' became 
        'Saghi' (gh = voiced velar fricative), logically enough once you had noticed 
        that a motor vehicle was 'taraghi', from Pidgin 'trak', itself from English 
        'truck'. I had a particularly sharp old man for my main informant. One 
        day, I don't know what got over me, I asked me to 'spell out' the Pidgin 
        word 'antap' ('on, above'). Without the slightest hesitation he said: 
      <P> a - ndra - vu 
      <P> 'Antap', I believe, he had 'stored' as 'andravu', three perfectly good 
        syllables of his mother tongue, which, in that language, would be pronounced 
        as, indeed, 'andravu', but which he *unfailingly* pronounced 'antap' in 
        Pidgin. (There is no such word as 'andravu' in the Lolovuevue dialect 
        or at least, I never came across one). I said an 'important' piece of 
        trivia because I think it reflects something we have wired-in, or close 
        to it, and is very important and should constantly be kept in mind when 
        we attempt to specify the desirable properties of a constructed language. 
        I haven't given any further thought to the matter, to tell you the truth, 
        and I do not know even vaguely what to make of it, nor how.

      <P> It's only in the minds of English (or French, or Italian, or...) that

        'tekemaout' in this Pidgin, as it would be in the corresponding sentence 
        in a native language. How would you say that he threw the briefcase into 
        the sea then? Let's try together: 
      <P> You say: Hem i tekemaout pepa long kes blong hem, sakem kes long solwota. 
        <BR>
        I say: Pretty good, but not quite there yet. Try again. <BR>
        You say: Hem i tekemaout pepa long kes blong hem pastaem, <BR>

        You say: Hem i tekemaout pepa long kes blong hem pastaem, <BR>
        nao hem i sakem kes blong hem long solwota. <BR>
        I say: Bull's eye! And do you know how you would say that if you were 
        <BR>
        thinking in, say, Sakao, Akei, whatever, instead of English? Here: 
      <P> <I>Hem i tekemaout pepa long kes blong hem pastaem.</I> Tekemaout pepa 
        finis nao, hem i sakem kes blong hem long solwota. 
      <P> That repetition of the verb of the previous sentence is only a stylistic

        Subject: In defense of grammatical gender </B> 
      <P> Me, I think grammatical gender as masc/fem is more trouble than it's 
        worth: makes for difficulties when speaking in general (even if you have 
        a neutal pronoun), what do you use for animals (who definitely have a 
        sex, but are usually called 'it' anyway). Personally, I very much like 
        the method used in Okrand's Klingon (and numerous natlangs as well, of 
        course), wherein there is no distinction between male and female (which 
        strikes me as a terribly trivial distinction to bake deeply into a language), 
        but there *is* a distinction between sentient and non-sentient objects. 
        Sentience is usually far more important to a speaker than the physiological 
        make-up (or worse, arbitrarily assigned category) of the person/thing 
        in question. The criteria suggested for sentience is ability to use language. 
        A servicable definition, and broad enough to allow fudging for grey areas 
        (there are always grey areas). 
      <P> That's actually one of the things I sort of miss in Lojban (not that 
        it should be changed: it would break Lojban's model and world-view). Since 
        it doesn't distinguish between sentient and non-sentient, there's no distinction 
        between, say, 'Who came here' and 'what came here'. Note that most natlangs 
        which lack a neuter for use with objects still retain separate words for 
        'who' and 'what', the distinction usually being person (sentient) vs. 
        thing (non-sentient). English-speakers would very likely be much less 
        uncomfortable with collapsing 'he' and 'she' into one pronoun than they 
        would collapsing 'who' and 'what'. Even in modern parlance, people are 
        averse to using 'it' as a gender-neutral (as opposed to neuter) pronoun, 
        as it somehow seems 'insulting', though it wouldn't be too bad a stretch 
        conceptually to go from neuter to neutral. 
      <P> If I were building my own conlang (something I probably ought to do, 
        just for kicks) (with a different purpose than Lojban or Esperanto or 
        anything, of course), I would put in pronouns for sentient and non-sentient 
        as my 'genders', along the lines of Okrand's 'ghaH/'oH' and 'chaH/bIH'.

        understand the use of the words 'pastaem', 'nao' and 'finis'. I would 
        have thought that the sequentiality of the events was obvious and would 
        not need disambiguation. 
      <P> Also, why did your translation contain 'blong hem'? The original English 
        sentence used 'the', not 'his'. In other words, I would think that the 
        sentence 
      <P> Hem i tekemaout pepa long kes, sakem kes long solwota. 
      <P> handles the original English sentence unambiguously. Am I missing something 
        here? 
      <P> Incidentally, this method of handling anaphoric reference is surprisingly 
        common among the world's languages; i.e., simply use the head noun of 
        a phrase as a 'pronoun' that can refer back to the entire phrase. We even 
        do it in English a lot, even though we do not consider it as truly anaphoric. 
        It may not seem very efficient, but Zipf's Law is not as well enforced 
        among the world's languages as most conlangers seem to think. Consider 
        languages such as Indonesian (with over 100 million speakers) that form 
        the plural of nouns by reduplication. For example, the Indonesian word 
        for '(college) student' is 'mahasiswa'. The plural 'students' is 'mahasiswa-mahasiswa'. 
        Indonesians don't seem to mind the obvious inefficiency at all. 
      <P> Perhaps we should adopt the motto: Down with Zipf's Law! :-)
