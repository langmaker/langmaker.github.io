      <H2>an international language</H2>
      <P> 
      <HR ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH="75%">
      <p></P>
      <P><SMALL> This is the text of a brochure distributed by the The International 
        Language (Ido) Society of Great Britain. The text was uploaded to CompuServe 
        by Ed. Robertson, and made into a web page by Rick Harrison in May of 
        1996. </SMALL> 
      <HR ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH="75%">
      <H3>Background</H3>
      <P>It would be very useful if we could talk with people in other countries, 
        or correspond with them, as we can with people in our own country. However, 
        the language barrier often makes this difficult if not impossible.</P>
      <P>The answer to this problem given by many people is: let them (that is, 
        everyone else) learn English! Certainly English is the most widely spoken 
        language in the world, but it requires a lot of time and some skill to 
        learn it at all well, and it is far from universally spoken. Moreover, 
        because it is the language of certain countries, it is not a neutral language. 
        For those who speak English, &quot;let them learn English&quot; may be 
        an attractive answer, but the French, for example, see things differently.</P>
      <P>Therefore the UN has five official languages, and UNESCO has eight. <I>[Haisam 
        K. Ido, who found this page while searching for his last name, points 
        out that the UN has six official languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, 
        French, Spanish and Russian.]</I> The European Community has a similar 
        number, and spends vast amounts of money on translation and interpreting. 
        Although English and French predominate in the EC, the Germans are now 
        asking for German to be used more.</P>
      <P>Using just one national language would give enormous political and cultural 
        advantages to the country or countries for which the chosen language is 
        the native tongue. Consequently this solution is often unacceptable to 
        the others, although the Universal Postal Union still uses only French.</P>
      <P>The answer to this situation is to use a neutral invented language like 
        Esperanto or Ido. Such a language would not replace natural languages 
        (that would be vandalism) but be used as a bridge between people who otherwise 
        could not communicate. In this way we can meet each other half way, with 
        little or no advantage for any one group.</P>
      <P>The chosen language should not be too artificial. The vocabulary should 
        be based on existing languages (some of which already have many words 
        in common, apart from slight differences in spelling and pronunciation). 
        The grammar should be as simple as possible, without all the exceptions 
        and idiomatic uses which plague the learner of national languages.</P>
      <P>This idea inspired among others Father Schleyer, the inventor of Volapuk, 
        and Dr L. Zamenhof, the inventor of Esperanto, whose language remains 
        the best known of its type over a century since it was first launched. 
        After some years of trying it - and some earlier and later inventions 
        - out in practice, various improvements were suggested.</P>
      <P>For example, Zamenhof required adjectives in Esperanto to agree in number 
        and case with the nouns they qualify, so an adjective has four possible 
        endings. There is no real need for this complication, as English and Hungarian 
        - with their invariable adjectives - show, and as Zamenhof later agreed. 
        However, for various reasons no changes were made to the rules of Esperanto.</P>
      <P>It was on the basis of improvements such as this that a group of scientists 
        and linguists developed Ido. The committee included the Danish linguist 
        Professor Otto Jespersen and the French mathematician and philosopher 
        Professor Louis Couturat. They took the best from Esperanto and from another 
        invention, Idiom Neutral, added further improvements, and developed a 
        language which is almost certainly the easiest in the world, yet at the 
        same time one of the most precise.</P>
      <P>Another improvement was one which again Zamenhof had pointed out would 
        be very logical and convenient. In Esperanto words for people and animals 
        (words such as 'actor' or 'lion') tend to be for the male, with the word 
        for the female being derived by using a suffix (often '-ess' in English). 
        The alternative Zamenhof later preferred, but unfortunately did not implement, 
        is to make such words neutral (like 'cousin' and 'pilot' in English), 
        and to derive both male and female forms by use of appropriate suffixes.</P>
      <P>Ido also has a useful pronoun, as does Finnish, which means either he 
        or she, and can therefore be used whenever it is irrelevant or unnecessary 
        to be more specific. Some people wish we had such a pronoun in English 
        so as to avoid saying 'he or she' or writing 'he/she' or 's/he'!</P>
      <P>In Ido, therefore, but not in Esperanto, these and other improvements 
        were adopted, and the result is preferred by nearly everyone who has studied 
        equally these two semi-artificial international languages or dialects 
        which otherwise share much in common - including the inspiration of Schleyer 
        and in particular of Zamenhof.</P>
      <P>It is to the credit of the Esperanto movement that, through its undoubted 
        fervour, it has done so much to make the idea of a neutral international 
        language relatively well known. However, although Esperanto is widely 
        known about, and is a relatively easy language, its special accented letters 
        and unnecessary complications have put off many who are attracted by the 
        idea it represents. Ido carries forward where Esperanto left off.</P>
      <P>Those who have experienced Ido know how good it is being able to concentrate 
        on what you want to say and not having to think, at the same time, about 
        how you have to say it.</P>
      <P>So much for the theory, but how does it work in practice? International 
        gatherings of people who speak Ido have taken place in a number of countries 
        and have demonstrated that the idea really works in practice.</P>
      <P>There are many publications in or about Ido, including vocabularies and 
        grammar books for speakers of a variety of languages from Swedish to Japanese. 
        There is even a surprising amount of poetry in Ido, including a wonderful 
        'heroical-comical' story in verse (Andreas Juste's 'La Serchado'). There 
        is a new world waiting to be discovered by anyone who makes the small 
        effort required to understand this remarkable language.</P>
      <P>Using the language is a hobby in itself of course, as well as a way of 
        contributing to better understanding in the world. 
      <H3>Introduction</H3>
      <P><B>INTERNATIONAL UNDERSTANDING</B></P>
      <P>The idea of an international language is simply to enable people who 
        have no other language in common to understand one another. Ido (pronounced 
        'ee-doh') was developed by linguists and scientists over a number of years. 
        It is the most practical language to be invented, and its usability has 
        been demonstrated many times, both in writing and in speech. Books in 
        and about Ido have been published in many countries, but as yet few people 
        know about it. So the purpose here is to show how practical it is. As 
        with many of the best inventions, simplicity is the key. Since Ido is 
        very much easier than any national language, much less time and effort 
        is needed if two people both learn Ido than if either learns the other's 
        mother tongue. Ido is the solution waiting to be discovered. It cuts through 
        the language barriers which hinder international understanding.</P>
      <P>Let's look now at some of Ido's features and discover a few of the 'secrets' 
        of its amazing simplicity.</P>
      <P><B>THE WORDS</B></P>
      <P>The vocabulary of Ido is based on that of the major European languages 
        - English, French, German, Italian, Russian and Spanish - and therefore 
        often indirectly on Latin.</P>
      <P>Sometimes the words for a concept are very similar in most of these languages, 
        so it is not difficult to choose a common form. In other cases the choice 
        is not so obvious, but generally the form chosen is based on as many languages 
        as possible.</P>
      <P>Here are some examples of words in Ido compared with the equivalents 
        in other languages where similar. In these examples Russian words have 
        been written using Latin letters. Often the word in Ido is not similar 
        to the most common equivalent in English but related to another English 
        word which can be used as an aid to memory. (These 'reminder' words are 
        also given in the lists below.)</P>
      <P>banko - E:bank, F:banque, G:Bank, I:banca, R:bank, S:banco <BR>
        bona - E:good (but remember 'bonus'), F:bon, I:buono, S:bueno <BR>
        donar - E:to give (but remember 'donor'), F:donner, I:dare, donare, S:dar 
        <BR>
        filtrar - E:to filter, F:filtrer, G:filtrieren, I:filtrare, R:filtr, S:filtrar 
        <BR>
        gardeno - E:garden, F:jardin, G:Garten, I:giardino, S:jardin <BR>
        kavalo - E:horse (but remember 'cavalry'), F:cheval, I:cavallo, S:cavalo 
        <BR>
        maro - E:sea (but remember 'marine'), F:mer, G:Meer, I:mare, S:mar <BR>
        naciono - E:nation, F:nation, G:Nation, I:nazione, R:nacia, S:nacion <BR>
        studiar - E:to study, F: etudier, G:studieren, I:studiare, S:estudiar 
        <BR>
        yuna - E:young, F:jeune, G:jung, R:yuniy.</P>
      <P><B>SAYING THE WORDS</B></P>
      <P>Ido uses the 26 letters of the 'Latin' alphabet, without any of the accented 
        letters which vary from language to language. So it can be typed, printed 
        or used with computers in most countries without any difficulty. Many 
        letters are pronounced as in English. Note the following, however: c is 
        always pronounced as ts (as in bits), never as k or s. The letter s is 
        always sharp as in song and bus, never dull as in rose. The letter g is 
        always hard as in get and brag, never soft as in page. The letter j is 
        pronounced as in French and like the s in pleasure. The letter r should 
        be slightly trilled and never silent. As a pair of letters, ch is pronounced 
        as in church and sh as in shine.</P>
      <P>The vowels a, e, i, o, u are pronounced much as in Spanish and Italian 
        and as in the words <I>fAther, Eight, machIne, tOtal, rUle. </I>Now practise 
        saying the following words: pasas (pahsahs), paco (pahtsoh), generaciono 
        (gheneratsiohnoh), jetar (jairtahrr), libro (leebroh), dum (doom). The 
        accent or stress falls on the last syllable but one for all words except 
        infinitives which are stressed on the last syllable. For example: generaciOno, 
        mUri, universAla, telefOno, Exter, mUlte; but klozAr (to close), pensAr 
        (to think), dankAr (to thank). When a word ends in a vowel preceded by 
        i or u, the two vowels at the end of the word count as one syllable. So, 
        for example, we say rAdio (not radIo), famIlio, mAnuo.</P>
      <P><B>TYPES OF WORDS</B></P>
      <P>Ido helps the reader or listener to understand the function of a word. 
        This is done by using endings which often signal the word type. For example, 
        a noun (a word for something) ends with the letter -o in the sigular, 
        as in kavalo (horse), sukro (sugar), kozo (thing), puero (child). There 
        is no equivalent to English 'a' or 'an' as it is not needed. The equivalent 
        of 'the' is la: so la kavalo means 'the horse'. The plural of a noun ends 
        with the letter -i in place of -o. It is easy to see the meaning of kavali 
        (horses), kozi (things) and pueri (children).</P>
      <P>Here are some nouns: <BR>
        amiko - friend (amicable) <BR>
        animalo - animal <BR>
        aquo - water (aquatic) <BR>
        batelo - boat <BR>
        butiko - shop (boutique) <BR>
        chambro - room, chamber <BR>
        dio - day (diary) <BR>
        domo - house (domestic) <BR>

        floro - flower (florist) <BR>
        foresto - forest <BR>
        frukto - fruit (fructify) <BR>
        hundo - dog (hound) <BR>
        kapo - head (capital) <BR>
        kavalo - horse (cavalry) <BR>
        kozo - thing <BR>
        libro - book (library) <BR>
        ligno - wood (ligneous) <BR>
        linguo - language (linguist) <BR>

        mondo - world (mundane) <BR>
        muro - wall (mural) <BR>
        pano - bread (pantry) <BR>
        patro - father (paternal) <BR>
        peco - piece <BR>
        pedo - foot (pedal) <BR>
        persono - person <BR>
        pomo - apple <BR>
        pordo - door (portal) <BR>
        puero - child (puerile) <BR>
        rivero - river <BR>
        stulo - chair <BR>
        sukro - sugar (sucrose) <BR>
        tablo - table <BR>
        tempo - time (temporary) <BR>
        urbo - town (urban) <BR>
        vespero - evening (vespers) <BR>
        vorto - word</P>
      <P>Adjectives (words which describe things) end with the letter -a, as in 
        rapida (fast), plena (full), bela (beautiful) and facila (easy). Advanced 
        users may, particularly in verse, omit (elide) the final letter -a but 
        normally it is retained as a useful indicator.</P>
      <P>Here are some adjectives: <BR>
        alta - high (altitude) <BR>
        bela - beautiful (belle) <BR>
        bona - good (bonus) <BR>
        dolca - sweet (dulcet) <BR>
        dormanta - sleeping (dormant) <BR>
        facila - easy (facilitate) <BR>
        felica - happy (felicity) <BR>
        granda - big, large <BR>
        interesanta - interesting <BR>
        kelka - some <BR>
        klara - clear (clarity) <BR>
        kolda - cold <BR>
        kurta - short (curtail) <BR>
        mikra - small (microscope) <BR>
        multa - much, many (multiply) <BR>
        lenta - slow <BR>
        nova - new (novelty) <BR>
        omna - all, every (omnipotent) <BR>
        plena - full (plenty) <BR>
        plura - several (plural) <BR>
        poka - few <BR>
        rapida - fast, quick, rapid <BR>
        saja - wise (sage) <BR>
        simpla - simple <BR>
        varma - warm <BR>
        utila - useful (utility) <BR>
        vera - true (veritable) <BR>
        yuna - young</P>
      <P><B>USING WORDS TOGETHER</B></P>
      <P>An adjective can be placed before or after the noun it qualifies or refers 
        to. For example, &quot;fast horses&quot; can be rapida kavali or kavali 
        rapida; &quot;universal language&quot; is universala linguo or linguo 
        universala. Take some words from the lists and put together some simple 
        combinations. See how easy it is: la lenta kavalo; granda flori; libro 
        interesanta; la mikra reda pomi; linguo facila.</P>
      <P><B>VERBS FOR ACTION</B></P>
      <P>Verbs (words which mostly describe actions) are particularly easy compared 
        with most languages. The infinitive is indicated by the ending -ar as 
        in vidar (to see), pensar (to think). The present tense is indicated by 
        the ending -as. For example, vidas (see or sees); pensas (think or thinks); 
        klozas (close or closes); la hundo dormas (the dog sleeps).</P>
      <P>Here are some verbs: <BR>
        amar - like (amity) <BR>
        apertar - open (aperture) <BR>
        bezonar - need <BR>

      <P><B>USING MORE WORDS TOGETHER</B></P>
      <P>Now we have enough building blocks to make slightly more ambitious phrases. 
        For example, sukro esas dolca (sugar is sweet), la puero questionas la 
        matro (the child questions the mother), la pomi esas granda (the apples 
        are large), kavalo esas animalo (a horse is an animal), kavali esas animali 
        (horses are animals), la mikra hundo kuras en la foresto (the little dog 
        runs in the forest).</P>
      <P>Make up some more phrases for yourself in the same way. In contrast to 
        many languages, in Ido the adjective does not vary to &quot;agree&quot; 
        with the noun, and the verb does not vary according to the subject, so 
        you can hardly go wrong.</P>
      <P><B>ADVERBS ADD INTEREST</B></P>
      <P>Adjectives can be changed into adverbs by replacing that final letter 
        -a with the letter -e, as in rapide (rapidly), facile (easily), klare 
        (clearly) and bele (beautifully). Now add some adverbs to adjectives or 
        verbs: vere facila (truly easy), parolar felice (to speak happily), la 
        hundi serchas rapide (the dogs search quickly).</P>
      <P>There are also some adverbs which are not made from adjectives. For example, 
        hike (here), tre (very), anke (also). Conjunctions are words used for 
        joining ideas. For example, e (and), o (or), ma (but). Some of these and 
        other types of words, such as prepositions, are given in the next list. 
        These words do not end with any particular letter.</P>
      <P>Some words of other types: <BR>
        a - to <BR>
        anke - also <BR>
        ante - before <BR>
        apud - beside <BR>
        ca - this <BR>
        de - from <BR>
        di - of <BR>
        du - two <BR>
        dum - during <BR>
        e - and <BR>
        en - in <BR>
        exter - outside <BR>
        hike - here <BR>
        hodie - today <BR>
        ibe - there <BR>
        inter - between <BR>
        ja - already <BR>
        kam - than <BR>
        ke - that [conj.] <BR>
        kun - with [together] <BR>
        la - the <BR>
        ma - but <BR>
        min - less <BR>
        ne [placed before the verb] - not <BR>
        no - no [as an answer] <BR>
        nun - now <BR>
        nur - only <BR>
        o - or <BR>
        per - with [by means of] <BR>
        plu [with an adjective or adverb] - more <BR>
        por - for <BR>
        pos - after <BR>
        pri - concerning, about <BR>
        pro - because of <BR>
        proxim - near <BR>
        qua - which <BR>
        quale - how <BR>
        quo - what <BR>
        se - if <BR>
        sen - without <BR>
        sub - under <BR>
        sur - on <BR>
        ta - that [not this] <BR>
        til - until <BR>
        tre - very <BR>
        tro - too <BR>
        tri - three <BR>
        ube - where <BR>
        un - one <BR>
        yes - yes</P>
      <P><B>YOU, ME AND THEY</B></P>
      <P>Personal pronouns are words like &quot;you&quot; and &quot;they&quot;. 
        In Ido they do not change in the way some of them do in English, so me 
        means either &quot;I&quot; or &quot;me&quot;, and ni means either &quot;we&quot; 
        or &quot;us&quot;. As a result there are fewer words to learn. A particularly 
        useful pronoun is lu which can be used whenever we don't want to, or can't, 
        be more exact, as it often avoids the need to say &quot;il o el&quot; 
        (he or she).</P>
      <P>me - I, me; vu - you (one person); ilu - he, him; elu - she, her; olu 
        - it; lu - he, she, it; ni - we, us; vi - you (several people); li - they, 
        them.</P>
      <P>To form the possessive pronoun, add the letter -a: mea - my; vua - your; 
        ilua - his; elua - her; olua - its; nia - our; and so on.</P>
      <P>Now we have enough material to write some even better sentences: Ni vidas 
        bela batelo sur la maro; vua hundo esas tre granda; li kuras rapide a 
        la rivero; vi povas komprar pano en la urbo; me komprenas nun, e me trovas 
        ke Ido esas vere simpla.</P>
      <P><B>GAINING FLUENCY</B></P>
      <P>Using the words listed, you can already put together very many short 
        phrases and sentences. Make a start with pronouns and verbs, varying each 
        in turn: me skribas, elu skribas; ni venas, li venas. Then take some adjectives 
        and nouns, again varying each in turn: granda domo, granda pomi, granda 
        hundo; bela domi, bela animalo, bela kozi.</P>
      <P>Go on to make longer phrases: mea amiko venas a nia domo; la tablo e 
        la stuli esas en la chambro; la maro esas varma nun; olu ne esas kolda; 
        la mondo bezonas facila linguo; du personi sidas sur la muro; ni savas 
        ke ligno esas tre utila. Playing with words like this is an excellent 
        way of building confidence and fluency, and in Ido it is exceptionally 
        easy, as you can readily discover for yourself.</P>
      <P><B>PAST AND FUTURE</B></P>
      <P>What about saying something like &quot;they came&quot; instead of &quot;they 
        come&quot;? For the past tense, the ending to use is -is. So li venis 
        means &quot;they came&quot;, and li dankis means &quot;they thanked&quot;. 
        For the future tense the ending is -os. So li venos means &quot;they will 
        come&quot;, and li skribos means &quot;they will write&quot;. As there 
        are no irregular verbs, you can already understand the following: elu 
        vidis bela flori en la gardeno; vu trovos kelka pano sur la tablo.</P>
      <P><B>CONCLUSION</B></P>
      <P>You now have a good idea of how Ido works and how easy it is. It was 
        originally based largely on Esperanto (an earlier invention), but with 
        many improvements. The result is a simple yet effective language which 
        is easy to pronounce and sounds somewhat like Italian. You can easily 
        build on your knowledge and could soon be able to understand much more. 
        A useful knowledge of Ido can be acquired in a small fraction of the time 
        needed for any national language. Through Ido you can correspond with 
        people in other countries, and read books and magazines written in this 
        international language. Ido is the key that opens the door to a wider 
        world.</P>
      <P><B>FURTHER INFORMATION</B></P>
      <P>Details of books in and about Ido are available from the Ido Book Service. 
        The voluntary movement for this language is, of course, itself international, 
        and books about Ido are also available in a variety of national languages. 
        In addition to national societies there is an international organisation, 
        the Union for the International Language (Ido), which publishes a periodical 
        called <I>Progreso.</I> To make contact with the network of people who 
        use Ido, write to one of the representatives who include the following.</P>
