      <H2>Essential World English </H2>
      <H3>an artificial language for global communication </H3>
      <P> Here is a micro-introduction to Lancelot Hogben's artificial language 
        (or &quot;controlled language&quot;) Essential World English. This is 
        the text of an e-mail message I received in early August, 1995. Unfortunately 
        I have lost the sender's name and e-mail address, so I cannot give him 
        proper credit. - Rick Harrison 
      <HR>
      <P> You will be delighted in Lancelot Hogben's <I>Essential World English 
        </I>(EWE), and ought to have your own copy. 
      <P> Hogben's purpose is given in the first chapter: <BR>
      <BLOCKQUOTE> One cannot speak too highly of Ogden's intention. He stated 
        clearly and courageously, as no one before, a neglected task of language 
        teaching and of language planning. To this end, he offered a recipe seemingly 
        plausible to some of us. If his own solution of the problem he tackled 
        was unsatisfactory for reasons indicated below, Ogden assuredly blazed 
        a trail for others to follow. This book is not necessary because it can 
        offer a solution that is final. It is timely, because it follows a new 
        trail inspired by Ogden's failure. With due recognition of his unique 
        achievement, it is therefore important to say charitably at the outset 
        why Basis was bogus. <BR>
        As said, a highly educated person may require a vocabulary of at least 
        30,000 items for extensive reading. That one can say -- technical jargon 
        apart -- everything one needs to say with 850 words in the English of 
        the Authorised Version or of Winston Churchill at his best is therefore 
        at first sight an impressive achievement. On more mature reflection, several 
        considerations prompt second thoughts, in particular: <BR>
        (a) the Basic vocabulary contains many items which have very different 
        meanings, and by the same token, are translatable by many different words 
        in any other language; <BR>
        (b) to accomplish the ostensible end in view, Basic usage, though admittedly 
        by no means alien to the eye or ear of anyone with a keen aprreciation 
        of native English, relies extensively on use of idioms invoking particles 
        which have no semantic sanction in their own right; <BR>
        (c) the learner who starts with no native knowledge of English idiom is 
        therefore at sea, and liable to form not easily broken habits of unacceptable 
        usage. <BR>
        The new start which this book advocates is that neither of the first-named 
        preceding devices to reduce the mnemonic load of learning achieves the 
        end in view. This follows if the reader is willing to concede two assertions: 
        <BR>
        (a) it is by no means manifestly easier to learn several unrelated different 
        meanings of the same word than to learn the same number of different words, 
        each with a clear-cut semantic reference; <BR>
        (b) replacement of otherwise essential words not deemed to be so by wholly 
        arbitrary combinations (e.g. <B>put up with</B> for <B>tolerate</B> or 
        <B>forbear</B>) accomplishes no reduction of mnemonic load for the beginner. 
        <BR>
        In place of Ogden's 850-word list, we here offer a 1300-item list of what 
        we call <I>Essential Semantic Units, </I>meaning thereby a semantically 
        unique word and a instruction where necessary with respect to its usage, 
        in particular: <BR>
        (a) what arbitrary particles may accompany it (cf. laugh AT P, contrast 
        X WITH Y, the same A ... AS B); <BR>
        (b) if a so-called transitive verb, whether <B>to do</B> is interchangeable 
        with <B>doing</B> or for <B>for doing</B> as its object (cf. different 
        usage with <B>cease</B> and <B>finish</B>). (Though one can say acceptably 
        <I>cease to work </I>or <I>cease working, </I>one cannot acceptably say 
        <I>finish to work.</I> <BR>
        With the exception of less than half a dozen elements of the grammatical 
        matrix (with, to, that, have, be), each listed semantic unit has an <B>unequivocal</B> 
        reference. </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P> The List of Essential Semantic Units (LESU) is given in 26 lessons of 
        50 words each, followed by two lessons of supplementary words. There are 
        glossaries of EWE equivalents for Standard English terms not included 
        in the LESU. 
      <P> More words can be made from these by the following rules: UN-V (e.g. 
        UNABLE), IN- (e.g. INACTIVE), UN-V-ED (e.g. UNACCUSTOMED), -ER (e.g. ATTACKER), 
        UN-V-ABLE (e.g. UNANSWERABLE), IN-V-ABLE (e.g. INCOMPARABLE), -LESS (e.g. 
        AIMLESS), (UN-)V-ING (e.g. ACCORDING). 
      <P> EWE ought to be compared with Basic English, the Voice of America special 
        word list, and Universal Language Dictionary elements. 
      <P> Here is my synopsis of LESU. You need the book to understand completely.
