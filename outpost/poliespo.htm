      <H1>Poliespo </H1>
      <P> <B>Date: 10-Nov-92 03:46 EST <BR>
        <B>From: Dan Maxwell maxwell@ltb.bso.nl <BR>
        <B>Subj: Poliespo </B></B></B> 
      <P> I came across the following item in the October issue of *Esperanto*: 
      <P> The 40 year old Nvwtohiyada Idehesdi Sequoyah (previously Billy Joe 
        Waldon) was condemned to death last year in California. Not everyone believes 
        that the Cherokee Indian, who created 'Poliespo' (Esperanto extended by 
        Cherokee words), was guilty of murders. His defense committee is striving 
        to save him from the death penalty [two addresses of his defense committee 
        follow, one in Berkeley, USA, and one in Horgen, Switzerland]. 
      <P> speculation: Don Harlow lives near Berkeley, I think, so maybe this 
        is one of the things taking up his time in place of conlang. 
      <P> questions: Does Poliespo count as a new language for Rick H's list? 
        Does Esperanto phonology have to be extended to accomodate Cherokee words? 
        Esperanto orthography does not have 'y' or 'q', but the sounds apparently 
        indicated by these letters can be approximated fairly well in Esperanto 
        orthography. The real question to me is the nature of the consonant cluster 
        at the beginning of the first name and how many others like it are found 
        in Cherokee. 
      <P> Perhaps this item raises more general questions about how/whether an 
        existing IAL can be influenced by contact with other languages. In this 
        case, the answer might depend on how the above story comes out.

        <B>Subj: Poliespo </B></B></B> 
      <P> Nick Nicholas mailed me some information he had on Poliespo several 
        months back. I was rather underwhelmed by the whole thing. It has some 
        interesting points, but whatever positive side it has tends to be drowned 
        out by the whole tone of the material. It appears to be, in Nick's words, 
        the work of a crank. Oh, it's plainly based on real Esperanto, and I'm 
        sure the Cherokee is genuine, but it looks to me like a combination of 
        some of the worst aspects of both. There's also an invitation to join 
        an obvious pyramid scheme for 'making money' (for him, not you), promises 
        of how using Poliespo will somehow gain you a Cherokee soul, etc. 
      <P> He uses some rather bizarre orthography, involving underscored and overstuck 
        characters to handle the nasalizations and other characteristics of the 
        Poliespo phonology, but I recall he also mentions another orthography, 
        non-romic, which he claims has the advantage of disambiguating things 
        like 'malica' from 'mal- + -*ica'. I'm not sure if this is the same as 
        the old Sequoyah orthography, which he mentions. I haven't looked at the 
        stuff in a while. If anyone's interested, I could probably make copies 
        of what I have and mail it out. 
      <P> I'll take another look and try to write something meaningful for you 
        all... 
      <P> I didn't know he was on trial, though....

        <B>Subj: Poliespo </B></B></B> 
      <P> Well, I found the material Nick sent me about Poliespo. Started scanning 
        over it again last night. It's worse than I remember it (though the linguistic 
        work per se is a little better than I remember). I promised myself I'd 
        get to show you the orthography (the romified orthography) for this. I'll 
        try to explain what the characters look like. Hang on: 
      <P> a, a-hat, a-with-a-slash-through-it, slashed-a-hat, b, b-breve, c, c-hat, 
        d, e, e-hat, f, g, g-hat, h, h-hat, i, i-breve, i-breve-followed-by-colon, 
        i-breve-with-an-acute-accent, i-hat, i-hat-followed-by-colon, i-hat-accented, 
        j, j-hat, k, k-breve, l, m, m-breve, n, n-breve, o, o-hat, p, p-overstruck-with-w, 
        s, s-hat, t, t-hat, t-overstruck-with-v, u, u-hat, u-breve, v, z, z-hat, 
        z-breve, q, q-with-acute-accent, q-hat, q-hat-with-acute-accent, w, w-with-acute-accent, 
        w-hat, w-hat-with-acute-accent, x, x-with-acute-accent, y, 2, 2-with-accent. 
      <P> I wouldn't kid you about something like this. See below for notes on 
        the acute accents. The i's-with-colons mean double length, used in something 
        like two affixes (as in Cherokee, apparently). Elsewhere length is unimportant. 
      <P> Nineteen(!) vowels (this from a pamphlet that has the gall to say, a 
        few paragraphs later (translated from Esperanto): IN ESPERANTO AND IN 
        CHEROKEE, BUT NOT IN ENGLISH (THE LARGEST EUROPEAN LANGUAGE), THE NORMAL 
        5-VOWEL PATTERN WITH ONE OR TWO SMALL MODIFICATIONS IS USED. (Part of 
        a list of similarities between E-o and Cherokee, indicating the wonderful 
        rightness of Poliespo or something)). Vowels are: a,e,i,o,u as in Esperanto. 
        a-hat, e-hat, o-hat, and u-hat (NOT i-hat), are the same but nasalized. 
        slashed-a is \ae, as in American 'ash', with a hat it's nasalized. i-breve 
        is [I] as in 'ship', i-hat is nasalized i-breve (not i!). q is the sound 
        in 'girl', etc. with a hat it's nasalized. w is the sound in 'awful', 
        'law' (pardon me for not using IPA, but I'm not going to trust *his* analysis, 
        and I'm not going to trust mine, and I'd probably misrepresent anyway. 
        So cope with the na&iuml;ve explanation by example), w-hat is nasalized. 
        x is schwa, its nasal form is written 2 (so chosen because 2 resembles 
        the author's hand-drawn symbol of the profile of a nose). 
      <P> Consonants as in E-o, unfamiliar ones: b-breve, k-breve, m-breve, n-breve 
        are as their E-o equivalents, but (near as I can understand) pre-aspirated 
        (or just aspirated?) with a *nasal* h. t-hat is voiceless th, t-overstruck-with-v 
        is voiced th. p-overstruck-with-w is 'pw' as one consonant (labialized 
        p?). z-hat is 'kts' as one consonant, z-breve is voiced analogue (gdz). 
        y is '^hy' (esperanto ^h) pronounced as one consonant (palalized ^h?). 
        Glottal stops, sometimes required, are not generally written. And I don't 
        think the tones(!) are either, though the tonal system and its significance 
        are hard to make out. Then again, I didn't try very hard. Wait, my mistake. 
        The acute accents are used to indicate stransition from tone 2 to tone 
        3 (rising). Something is also said about a fourth tone, and maybe a first, 
        but it's not always easy to tell when he's talking about Cherokee, Poliespo, 
        or the myriad versions and incarnations of the intermediate and related 
        languages he's developed. 
      <P> Also talks of the 'Arabic Poliespo alphabet', so named because it uses 
        more Arabic numerals, nothing to do with that language's orthography per 
        se. Uses other symbols for hard-to-get Poliespo symbols: z-hat --&gt; 
        3, t-hat --&gt; 4, a-hat --&gt; 5, t-overstruck-with-v --&gt; 6, slashed-a 
        --&gt; 7, p-overstruck-with-w --&gt; 8, slashed-a-hat --&gt; 9, z-breve 
        --&gt; %, i-breve --&gt; ), i-breve-accent --&gt; (, i-hat --&gt; ], i-hat-accent 
        --&gt; [, w-hat --&gt; $, w-hat-accent --&gt; &amp;, x-hat --&gt; !, 2-accent 
        --&gt; 1/2, q-accent --&gt; =, q-hat --&gt; +, q-hat-accent --&gt; #. 
        He makes a point to say that the symbols were chosen to resemble what 
        they represent in some fashion. To him, maybe. 
      <P> Notes that getting the pronunciation shouldn't be too tough; it was 
        developed from his accent, which he says is similar to fairly standard 
        central/south/western US, so all you have to do is see some Hollywood 
        movies or get English tapes from America, until the first Poliespo teaching 
        cassette comes out. How convenient can you get? 
      <P> I should note that he doesn't get into phonology until well into the 
        paper, so you're sort of lost in the orthography earlier. If you think 
        the phonology is rough, you don't want to think about the morphology and 
        grammar. The language of discourse, for the most part, is reasonably correct 
        Esperanto, but it's cramped and hard to read, and you have to watch out 
        for his frequent abbreviations, which he uses as Esperanto roots with 
        no marking, and at least one neologism, 'pi', which he uses as a gender-neutral, 
        sentience-neutral third-person-singular pronoun. 
      <P> There seem to be conjugational affixes to indicate both subject and 
        object (cf. Okrand's Klingon, which, after all, took the idea from Native 
        American languages), and apparently a dual in second person. The affixes 
        have different forms depending on whether they precede consonants or vowels 
        (allomorphy! Run! Hide!). If I read the table aright (probability about 
        60%), there are 65 combinations of subj/obj taken into consideration, 
        with two sets of beforeC/beforeV versions for each. Not sure how many 
        are distinct. Probably most. Words wind up being pretty damn large. 
      <P> There seem to be agglutinative constructions for temporal and spatial 
        tenses (rather fine-grained, I think, for some), some evidential markers 
        (attested/not attested by speaker...), hmmm, do I see dasuinction between 
        living and non-living subjects/objects in grammar? I think so, at least 
        in some cases (I'm skimming tables with little understanding, so take 
        with a grain of salt). I think there are 'try-to-X' contructions, as well 
        as more complex ones. 
      <P> Positive side to the paper: It includes a table of the Sequoyah Syllabary 
        (which he periodically uses here and there when discussing Cherokee). 
        If you trust what he has to say, that could be a useful addition to a 
        lingvomaniac's collection. 
      <P> Um, lessee... What else can I say, without actually going much into 
        this mess? I suspect I've already said more than enough. Hey, as the paper 
        says, &quot;POLIESPO IS YOUR GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE AN IROQUOIAN 
        SPIRIT.&quot; Lucky me. He's got plans for a few organizations as well, 
        and Nick sent me some of their one-page flyers as well. And you know? 
        If person A recruits person B, A automatically receives, credited to A's 
        account, 20% of the membership dues of B, and 20% of the money paid to 
        the organization by B during B's lifetime. But I magnanimously waive my 
        rights to your dough under that policy if any of you decides to join up. 
        Sounds like a pyramid scheme to me... Organizations I see: The 'Monda 
        Esperanto-Organiza^jo' (World Esperanto Organization)... 'Monda Poliespo-Organiza^jo' 
        (World Poliespo Organization)... 'Monda Homaranisma Eklezio' (World Humanitarian 
        Church)... and the 'Unui^gintaj Nacioj de A^utonomiaj Popoloj' (United 
        Nations of Autonomous Peoples). Each has its own little agenda, which 
        I'll not get into here. 
      <P> OK, I've gone on long enough...
