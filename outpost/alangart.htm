Greetings.  I'm writing to request that someone create the newsgroup

alt.language.artificial ... The purpose of the newsgroup will be to

provide a forum for messages in and about artificial languages other

than those which have their own newsgroups/mailing lists (i.e. other than

Esperanto, Klingon and Lojban).

Subject: alt.language.artificial

Date: 11 Sep 1996



I posted this article from another ISP, but apparently it did not propagate.

So excuse me for repeating myself if you have already seen this.



I propose the creation of a newsgroup called alt.language.artificial for

the purpose of discussions in and about invented languages, especially

those languages which do not already have newsgroups or mailing lists

for their supporters.  This newsgroup could also handle discussions of

language design in general.  (There is a mailing list called &quot;conlang&quot; for

the latter purpose, but the large amount of barely-relevant traffic in

conlang -- more than a megabyte per month -- has made it less useful in

recent months.  In any event, the existence of conlang-list does not

negate the need for alt.language.artificial, just as the existence of

linguist-list does not negate the need for sci.lang)



There is already a newsgroup called alt.language.urdu.poetry, so adding

alt.language.artificial will not inflate the top-level hierarchy of alt.

groups.



I am not able to send newgroup messages from my ISPs, so I am asking

for help from those who are able to do so.

I wholeheartedly support alt.language.artificial ... I think it'll be

a lot more useful than a lot of alt.groups out there. (Granted, that

last isn't saying much.)



A lot of folks out there, I suspect, have a keen interest in

&quot;artificial&quot; languages, and we'd love to have a forum in which to

discuss this, one of the most challenging of hobbies.



I vote yes, for what it's worth ... Someone should newgroup it soon if

there isn't substantial opposition.

Yeah, I'd like to see this one.  You might want to mention in the charter

that computer languages should be excluded from the newsgroup.

Well, I personally would prefer &quot;alt.language.planned&quot;, and I imagine

Jeffrey Henning would prefer &quot;alt.language.model&quot;.  I proposed

&quot;artificial&quot; because the phrase &quot;artificial language&quot; is the most widely

used term for these tongues, and is the phrase people are likely to use

when they go to search engines looking for this kind of data.  So I feel

we should use a name that will make it easy for people to find the

newsgroup.  I don't know how many people are aware of the new, improved

and politically correct term &quot;constructed language.&quot;  You can find the

phrase &quot;artificial language&quot; in some dictionaries, and Andrew Large's book

is entitled &quot;The Artificial Language Movement&quot;... I think &quot;constructed

language&quot; is rather new and obscure at this point.

I think some of the &quot;regulars&quot; in alt.config will help us out, after

This is a good idea; the mailing list has been getting so many messages per

day lately that I have a hard time keeping up.  With a newsgroup, I could just

follow the threads I'm interested in reading; it would be easier to find old

posts in Deja News than the conlang archives or my saved mail, and many people

who don't already know about the mailing list would be able to join the

discussions.  (I thought that was what alt.lang.design was intended for when

it was created, not knowing that alt.lang.* dealt with computer languages

rather than languages spoken by people.)

For your newsgroups file:

alt.language.artificial        Discussion and samples of invented languages.



CHARTER: This unmoderated newsgroup is a forum for discussion of  constructed 

human languages including their history, technical and  esthetic design 

considerations, practical applications, announcements of  new publications and 

web pages, bibliographic data, specimen texts, and  other relevant 

information.  



alt.language.artificial is not the appropriate place for discussing computer 

programming languages, the state of linguistics today, or  detailed 

descriptions of natural languages; please take those topics to  the 

appropriate newsgroups. 



THE NEED: The need for alt.language.artificial is demonstrated by frequent 

discussions of the topic in not-quite-appropriate newsgroups, and by the high 

volume of traffic in the &quot;conlang&quot; mailing list; some people have had to 

unsubscribe from the list due to mailbox overload.  The existence of over 30 

web sites devoted to the topic also indicates widespread interest.



HISTORY: I proposed this group in alt.config on 9 September 1996.  Seven 

messages supporting the proposal were posted and (as far as I know) no  

objections were posted in alt.config.  One person expressed misgivings in the 

conlang list, but several others indicated that they favor the  creation of 

the newsgroup.  Therefore I humbly request that you honor this  newgroup 

message.  -- Rick Harrison (hrick@magicnet.net)
