<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">taken to bind me, and at the same time with a violent pull, which gave me excessive pain, I a little loosened the strings that tied down my hair on the left side, so that I was just able to turn my head about two inches. &nbsp;But the creatures ran off a second time, before I could seize them; whereupon there was a great shout in a very shrill accent, and after it ceased I heard one of them cry aloud <I><B>Tolgo phonac</B></I>; when in an instant I felt above a hundred arrows discharged on my left hand, which, pricked me like so many needles; and besides, they shot another flight into the air, as we do bombs in Europe, whereof many, I suppose, fell on my body, (though I felt them not), and some on my face, which I immediately covered with my left hand...</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">...But I should have mentioned, that before the principal person began his oration, he cried out three times, <I><B>Langro dehul san</B></I> (these words and the former were afterwards repeated and explained to me); whereupon, immediately, about fifty of the inhabitants came and cut the strings that fastened the left side of my head, which gave me the liberty of turning it to the right, and of observing the person and gesture of him that was to speak...</FONT></div>

We began already to converse together in some sort; and the first words I learnt, were to express my desire &quot;that he would please give me my liberty;&quot; which I every day repeated on my knees. His answer, as I could comprehend it, was, &quot;that this must be a work of time, not to be thought on without the advice of his council, and that first I must <I><B>lumos kelmin pesso desmar lon emposo</B></I>;&quot; that is, swear a peace with him and his kingdom...</FONT></div>

<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">shall say something, when I have mentioned one illustrious person</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">more, who is called among them &quot;the universal artist.&quot; &nbsp;He told us</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">&quot;he had been thirty years employing his thoughts for the</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">improvement of human life.&quot; &nbsp;He had two large rooms full of</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">wonderful curiosities, and fifty men at work. &nbsp;Some were condensing</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">air into a dry tangible substance, by extracting the nitre, and</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">letting the aqueous or fluid particles percolate; others softening</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">marble, for pillows and pin-cushions; others petrifying the hoofs</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">of a living horse, to preserve them from foundering. &nbsp;The artist</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">himself was at that time busy upon two great designs; the first, to</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">sow land with chaff, wherein he affirmed the true seminal virtue to</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">be contained, as he demonstrated by several experiments, which I</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">was not skilful enough to comprehend. &nbsp;The other was, by a certain</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">composition of gums, minerals, and vegetables, outwardly applied,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">to prevent the growth of wool upon two young lambs; and he hoped,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">in a reasonable time to propagate the breed of naked sheep, all</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">over the kingdom.</FONT></div>
<bR>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">We crossed a walk to the other part of the academy, where, as I</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">have already said, the projectors in speculative learning resided.</FONT></div>
<bR>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">The first professor I saw, was in a very large room, with forty</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">pupils about him. &nbsp;After salutation, observing me to look earnestly</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">upon a frame, which took up the greatest part of both the length</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">and breadth of the room, he said, &quot;Perhaps I might wonder to see</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">him employed in a project for improving speculative knowledge, by</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">practical and mechanical operations. &nbsp;But the world would soon be</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">sensible of its usefulness; and he flattered himself, that a more</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">noble, exalted thought never sprang in any other man's head. &nbsp;Every</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">one knew how laborious the usual method is of attaining to arts and</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">sciences; whereas, by his contrivance, the most ignorant person, at</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">a reasonable charge, and with a little bodily labour, might write</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">books in philosophy, poetry, politics, laws, mathematics, and</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">theology, without the least assistance from genius or study.&quot; &nbsp;He</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">then led me to the frame, about the sides, whereof all his pupils</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">stood in ranks. &nbsp;It was twenty feet square, placed in the middle of</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">the room. &nbsp;The superfices was composed of several bits of wood,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">about the bigness of a die, but some larger than others. &nbsp;They were</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">all linked together by slender wires. &nbsp;These bits of wood were</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">covered, on every square, with paper pasted on them; and on these</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">papers were written all the words of their language, in their</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">several moods, tenses, and declensions; but without any order. &nbsp;The</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">professor then desired me &quot;to observe; for he was going to set his</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">engine at work.&quot; &nbsp;The pupils, at his command, took each of them</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">hold of an iron handle, whereof there were forty fixed round the</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">edges of the frame; and giving them a sudden turn, the whole</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">disposition of the words was entirely changed. &nbsp;He then commanded</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">six-and-thirty of the lads, to read the several lines softly, as</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">they appeared upon the frame; and where they found three or four</FONT></div>

<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">the four remaining boys, who were scribes. &nbsp;This work was repeated</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">three or four times, and at every turn, the engine was so</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">contrived, that the words shifted into new places, as the square</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">bits of wood moved upside down.</FONT></div>
<bR>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Six hours a day the young students were employed in this labour;</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">and the professor showed me several volumes in large folio, already</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">collected, of broken sentences, which he intended to piece</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">together, and out of those rich materials, to give the world a</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">complete body of all arts and sciences; which, however, might be</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">still improved, and much expedited, if the public would raise a</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">fund for making and employing five hundred such frames in Lagado,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">and oblige the managers to contribute in common their several</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">collections.</FONT></div>
<bR>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">He assured me &quot;that this invention had employed all his thoughts</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">from his youth; that he had emptied the whole vocabulary into his</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">frame, and made the strictest computation of the general proportion</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">there is in books between the numbers of particles, nouns, and</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">verbs, and other parts of speech.&quot;</FONT></div>
<bR>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">I made my humblest acknowledgment to this illustrious person, for</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">his great communicativeness; and promised, &quot;if ever I had the good</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">fortune to return to my native country, that I would do him</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">justice, as the sole inventor of this wonderful machine;&quot; the form</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">and contrivance of which I desired leave to delineate on paper, as</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">in the figure here annexed. &nbsp;I told him, &quot;although it were the</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">custom of our learned in Europe to steal inventions from each</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">other, who had thereby at least this advantage, that it became a</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">controversy which was the right owner; yet I would take such</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">caution, that he should have the honour entire, without a rival.&quot;</FONT></div>
<bR>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">We next went to the school of languages, where three professors sat</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">in consultation upon improving that of their own country.</FONT></div>
<bR>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">The first project was, to shorten discourse, by cutting</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">polysyllables into one, and leaving out verbs and participles,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">because, in reality, all things imaginable are but norms.</FONT></div>
<bR>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">The other project was, a scheme for entirely abolishing all words</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">whatsoever; and this was urged as a great advantage in point of</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">health, as well as brevity. &nbsp;For it is plain, that every word we</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">speak is, in some degree, a diminution of our lunge by corrosion,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">and, consequently, contributes to the shortening of our lives. &nbsp;An</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">expedient was therefore offered, &quot;that since words are only names</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">for things, it would be more convenient for all men to carry about</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">them such things as were necessary to express a particular business</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">they are to discourse on.&quot; &nbsp;And this invention would certainly have</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">taken place, to the great ease as well as health of the subject, if</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">the women, in conjunction with the vulgar and illiterate, had not</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">threatened to raise a rebellion unless they might be allowed the</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">liberty to speak with their tongues, after the manner of their</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">forefathers; such constant irreconcilable enemies to science are</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">the common people. &nbsp;However, many of the most learned and wise</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">adhere to the new scheme of expressing themselves by things; which</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">has only this inconvenience attending it, that if a man's business</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">be very great, and of various kinds, he must be obliged, in</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">proportion, to carry a greater bundle of things upon his back,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">unless he can afford one or two strong servants to attend him. &nbsp;I</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">have often beheld two of those sages almost sinking under the</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">weight of their packs, like pedlars among us, who, when they met in</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">the street, would lay down their loads, open their sacks, and hold</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">conversation for an hour together; then put up their implements,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">help each other to resume their burdens, and take their leave.</FONT></div>
<bR>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">But for short conversations, a man may carry implements in his</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">pockets, and under his arms, enough to supply him; and in his</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">house, he cannot be at a loss. &nbsp;Therefore the room where company</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">meet who practise this art, is full of all things, ready at hand,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">requisite to furnish matter for this kind of artificial converse.</FONT></div>
<bR>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Another great advantage proposed by this invention was, that it</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">would serve as a universal language, to be understood in all</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">civilised nations, whose goods and utensils are generally of the</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">same kind, or nearly resembling, so that their uses might easily be</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">comprehended. &nbsp;And thus ambassadors would be qualified to treat</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">with foreign princes, or ministers of state, to whose tongues they</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">were utter strangers.</FONT></div>
<bR>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">I was at the mathematical school, where the master taught his</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">pupils after a method scarce imaginable to us in Europe. &nbsp;The</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">proposition, and demonstration, were fairly written on a thin</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">wafer, with ink composed of a cephalic tincture. &nbsp;This, the student</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">was to swallow upon a fasting stomach, and for three days</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">following, eat nothing but bread and water. &nbsp;As the wafer digested,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">the tincture mounted to his brain, bearing the proposition along</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">with it. &nbsp;But the success has not hitherto been answerable, partly</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">by some error in the quantum or composition, and partly by the</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">perverseness of lads, to whom this bolus is so nauseous, that they</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">generally steal aside, and discharge it upwards, before it can</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">operate; neither have they been yet persuaded to use so long an</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">abstinence, as the prescription requires.</FONT></div>

<bR>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">The Luggnaggians are a polite and generous people; and although</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">they are not without some share of that pride which is peculiar to</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">all Eastern countries, yet they show themselves courteous to</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">strangers, especially such who are countenanced by the court. &nbsp;I</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">had many acquaintance, and among persons of the best fashion; and</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">being always attended by my interpreter, the conversation we had</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">was not disagreeable.</FONT></div>
<bR>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">One day, in much good company, I was asked by a person of quality,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">&quot;whether I had seen any of their struldbrugs, or immortals?&quot; &nbsp;I</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">said, &quot;I had not;&quot; and desired he would explain to me &quot;what he</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">meant by such an appellation, applied to a mortal creature.&quot; &nbsp;He</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">told me &quot;that sometimes, though very rarely, a child happened to be</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">born in a family, with a red circular spot in the forehead,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">directly over the left eyebrow, which was an infallible mark that</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">it should never die.&quot; &nbsp;The spot, as he described it, &quot;was about the</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">compass of a silver threepence, but in the course of time grew</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">larger, and changed its colour; for at twelve years old it became</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">green, so continued till five and twenty, then turned to a deep</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">blue: &nbsp;at five and forty it grew coal black, and as large as an</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">English shilling; but never admitted any further alteration.&quot; &nbsp;He</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">said, &quot;these births were so rare, that he did not believe there</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">could be above eleven hundred struldbrugs, of both sexes, in the</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">whole kingdom; of which he computed about fifty in the metropolis,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">and, among the rest, a young girl born; about three years ago:</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">that these productions were not peculiar to any family, but a mere</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">effect of chance; and the children of the struldbrugs themselves</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">were equally mortal with the rest of the people.&quot;</FONT></div>
<bR>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">I freely own myself to have been struck with inexpressible delight,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">upon hearing this account: &nbsp;and the person who gave it me happening</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">to understand the Balnibarbian language, which I spoke very well, I</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">could not forbear breaking out into expressions, perhaps a little</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">too extravagant. &nbsp;I cried out, as in a rapture, &quot;Happy nation,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">where every child hath at least a chance for being immortal! &nbsp;Happy</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">people, who enjoy so many living examples of ancient virtue, and</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">have masters ready to instruct them in the wisdom of all former</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">ages! but happiest, beyond all comparison, are those excellent</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">struldbrugs, who, being born exempt from that universal calamity of</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">human nature, have their minds free and disengaged, without the</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">weight and depression of spirits caused by the continual</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">apprehensions of death!&quot; &nbsp;I discovered my admiration that I had not</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">observed any of these illustrious persons at court; the black spot</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">on the forehead being so remarkable a distinction, that I could not</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">have easily overlooked it: &nbsp;and it was impossible that his majesty,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">a most judicious prince, should not provide himself with a good</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">number of such wise and able counsellors. &nbsp;Yet perhaps the virtue</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">of those reverend sages was too strict for the corrupt and</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">libertine manners of a court: &nbsp;and we often find by experience,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">that young men are too opinionated and volatile to be guided by the</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">sober dictates of their seniors. &nbsp;However, since the king was</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">pleased to allow me access to his royal person, I was resolved,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">upon the very first occasion, to deliver my opinion to him on this</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">matter freely and at large, by the help of my interpreter; and</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">whether he would please to take my advice or not, yet in one thing</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">I was determined, that his majesty having frequently offered me an</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">establishment in this country, I would, with great thankfulness,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">accept the favour, and pass my life here in the conversation of</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">those superior beings the struldbrugs, if they would please to</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">admit me.&quot;</FONT></div>
<bR>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">The gentleman to whom I addressed my discourse, because (as I have</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">already observed) he spoke the language of Balnibarbi, said to me,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">with a sort of a smile which usually arises from pity to the</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">ignorant, &quot;that he was glad of any occasion to keep me among them,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">and desired my permission to explain to the company what I had</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">spoke.&quot; &nbsp;He did so, and they talked together for some time in their</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">own language, whereof I understood not a syllable, neither could I</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">observe by their countenances, what impression my discourse had</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">made on them. &nbsp;After a short silence, the same person told me,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">&quot;that his friends and mine (so he thought fit to express himself)</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">were very much pleased with the judicious remarks I had made on the</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">great happiness and advantages of immortal life, and they were</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">desirous to know, in a particular manner, what scheme of living I</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">should have formed to myself, if it had fallen to my lot to have</FONT></div>

<bR>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">I answered, &quot;it was easy to be eloquent on so copious and</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">delightful a subject, especially to me, who had been often apt to</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">amuse myself with visions of what I should do, if I were a king, a</FONT></div>

<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">understanding the difference between life and death, I would first</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">resolve, by all arts and methods, whatsoever, to procure myself</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">riches. &nbsp;In the pursuit of which, by thrift and management, I might</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">reasonably expect, in about two hundred years, to be the wealthiest</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">man in the kingdom. &nbsp;In the second place, I would, from my earliest</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">youth, apply myself to the study of arts and sciences, by which I</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">should arrive in time to excel all others in learning. &nbsp;Lastly, I</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">would carefully record every action and event of consequence, that</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">happened in the public, impartially draw the characters of the</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">several successions of princes and great ministers of state, with</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">my own observations on every point. &nbsp;I would exactly set down the</FONT></div>

<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">diversions. &nbsp;By all which acquirements, I should be a living</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">treasure of knowledge and wisdom, and certainly become the oracle</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">of the nation.</FONT></div>
<bR>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">&quot;I would never marry after threescore, but live in a hospitable</FONT></div>

<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">should be a set of my own immortal brotherhood; among whom, I would</FONT></div>

<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Where any of these wanted fortunes, I would provide them with</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">convenient lodges round my own estate, and have some of them always</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">at my table; only mingling a few of the most valuable among you</FONT></div>

<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">several gradations by which corruption steals into the world, and</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">oppose it in every step, by giving perpetual warning and</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">instruction to mankind; which, added to the strong influence of our</FONT></div>

<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">ancient cities in ruins, and obscure villages become the seats of</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">kings; famous rivers lessening into shallow brooks; the ocean</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">leaving one coast dry, and overwhelming another; the discovery of</FONT></div>

<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">nations, and the most barbarous become civilized. &nbsp;I should then</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">see the discovery of the longitude, the perpetual motion, the</FONT></div>

<bR>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">I enlarged upon many other topics, which the natural desire of</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">endless life, and sublunary happiness, could easily furnish me</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">with. &nbsp;When I had ended, and the sum of my discourse had been</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">interpreted, as before, to the rest of the company, there was a</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">good deal of talk among them in the language of the country, not</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">without some laughter at my expense. &nbsp;At last, the same gentleman</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">who had been my interpreter, said, &quot;he was desired by the rest to</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">set me right in a few mistakes, which I had fallen into through the</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">common imbecility of human nature, and upon that allowance was less</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">answerable for them. &nbsp;That this breed of struldbrugs was peculiar</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">to their country, for there were no such people either in</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Balnibarbi or Japan, where he had the honour to be ambassador from</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">his majesty, and found the natives in both those kingdoms very hard</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">to believe that the fact was possible: &nbsp;and it appeared from my</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">astonishment when he first mentioned the matter to me, that I</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">received it as a thing wholly new, and scarcely to be credited.</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">That in the two kingdoms above mentioned, where, during his</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">residence, he had conversed very much, he observed long life to be</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">the universal desire and wish of mankind. &nbsp;That whoever had one</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">foot in the grave was sure to hold back the other as strongly as he</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">could. &nbsp;That the oldest had still hopes of living one day longer,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">and looked on death as the greatest evil, from which nature always</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">prompted him to retreat. &nbsp;Only in this island of Luggnagg the</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">appetite for living was not so eager, from the continual example of</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">the struldbrugs before their eyes.</FONT></div>
<bR>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">&quot;That the system of living contrived by me, was unreasonable and</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">unjust; because it supposed a perpetuity of youth, health, and</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">vigour, which no man could be so foolish to hope, however</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">extravagant he may be in his wishes. &nbsp;That the question therefore</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">was not, whether a man would choose to be always in the prime of</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">youth, attended with prosperity and health; but how he would pass a</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">perpetual life under all the usual disadvantages which old age</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">brings along with it. &nbsp;For although few men will avow their desires</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">of being immortal, upon such hard conditions, yet in the two</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">kingdoms before mentioned, of Balnibarbi and Japan, he observed</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">that every man desired to put off death some time longer, let it</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">approach ever so late: &nbsp;and he rarely heard of any man who died</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">willingly, except he were incited by the extremity of grief or</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">torture. &nbsp;And he appealed to me, whether in those countries I had</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">travelled, as well as my own, I had not observed the same general</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">disposition.&quot;</FONT></div>
<bR>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">After this preface, he gave me a particular account of the</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">struldbrugs among them. &nbsp;He said, &quot;they commonly acted like mortals</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">till about thirty years old; after which, by degrees, they grew</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">melancholy and dejected, increasing in both till they came to</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">fourscore. &nbsp;This he learned from their own confession: &nbsp;for</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">otherwise, there not being above two or three of that species born</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">in an age, they were too few to form a general observation by.</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">When they came to fourscore years, which is reckoned the extremity</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">of living in this country, they had not only all the follies and</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">infirmities of other old men, but many more which arose from the</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">dreadful prospect of never dying. &nbsp;They were not only opinionative,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">peevish, covetous, morose, vain, talkative, but incapable of</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">friendship, and dead to all natural affection, which never</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">descended below their grandchildren. &nbsp;Envy and impotent desires are</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">their prevailing passions. &nbsp;But those objects against which their</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">envy seems principally directed, are the vices of the younger sort</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">and the deaths of the old. &nbsp;By reflecting on the former, they find</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">themselves cut off from all possibility of pleasure; and whenever</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">they see a funeral, they lament and repine that others have gone to</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">a harbour of rest to which they themselves never can hope to</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">arrive. &nbsp;They have no remembrance of anything but what they learned</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">and observed in their youth and middle-age, and even that is very</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">imperfect; and for the truth or particulars of any fact, it is</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">safer to depend on common tradition, than upon their best</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">recollections. &nbsp;The least miserable among them appear to be those</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">who turn to dotage, and entirely lose their memories; these meet</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">with more pity and assistance, because they want many bad qualities</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">which abound in others.</FONT></div>

<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">&quot;If a struldbrug happen to marry one of his own kind, the marriage</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">is dissolved of course, by the courtesy of the kingdom, as soon as</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">the younger of the two comes to be fourscore; for the law thinks it</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">a reasonable indulgence, that those who are condemned, without any</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">fault of their own, to a perpetual continuance in the world, should</FONT></div>

<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">the poor ones are maintained at the public charge. &nbsp;After that</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">period, they are held incapable of any employment of trust or</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">profit; they cannot purchase lands, or take leases; neither are</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">they allowed to be witnesses in any cause, either civil or</FONT></div>

<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">by asking them what kings or great persons they can remember, and</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">then consulting history; for infallibly the last prince in their</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">mind did not begin his reign after they were fourscore years old.</FONT></div>
<bR>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">They were the most mortifying sight I ever beheld; and the women</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">more horrible than the men. &nbsp;Besides the usual deformities in</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">extreme old age, they acquired an additional ghastliness, in</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">proportion to their number of years, which is not to be described;</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">and among half a dozen, I soon distinguished which was the eldest,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">although there was not above a century or two between them.</FONT></div>

<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">The reader will easily believe, that from what I had hear and seen,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">my keen appetite for perpetuity of life was much abated. &nbsp;I grew</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">heartily ashamed of the pleasing visions I had formed; and thought</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">no tyrant could invent a death into which I would not run with</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">pleasure, from such a life. &nbsp;The king heard of all that had passed</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">between me and my friends upon this occasion, and rallied me very</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">pleasantly; wishing I could send a couple of struldbrugs to my own</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">country, to arm our people against the fear of death; but this, it</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">seems, is forbidden by the fundamental laws of the kingdom, or else</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">I should have been well content with the trouble and expense of</FONT></div>

<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">as any other country would be under the necessity of enacting, in</FONT></div>

<bR>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">My principal endeavour was to learn the language, which my master</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">(for so I shall henceforth call him), and his children, and every</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">servant of his house, were desirous to teach me; for they looked</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">upon it as a prodigy, that a brute animal should discover such</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">marks of a rational creature. &nbsp;I pointed to every thing, and</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">inquired the name of it, which I wrote down in my journal-book when</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">I was alone, and corrected my bad accent by desiring those of the</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">family to pronounce it often. &nbsp;In this employment, a sorrel nag,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">one of the under-servants, was very ready to assist me.</FONT></div>
<bR>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">In speaking, they pronounced through the nose and throat, and their</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">language approaches nearest to the High-Dutch, or German, of any I</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">know in Europe; but is much more graceful and significant. &nbsp;The</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">emperor Charles V. made almost the same observation, when he said</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">&quot;that if he were to speak to his horse, it should be in High-</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Dutch.&quot;</FONT></div>
<bR>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">The curiosity and impatience of my master were so great, that he</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">spent many hours of his leisure to instruct me. &nbsp;He was convinced</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">(as he afterwards told me) that I must be a Yahoo; but my</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">teachableness, civility, and cleanliness, astonished him; which</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">were qualities altogether opposite to those animals. &nbsp;He was most</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">perplexed about my clothes, reasoning sometimes with himself,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">whether they were a part of my body: &nbsp;for I never pulled them off</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">till the family were asleep, and got them on before they waked in</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">the morning. &nbsp;My master was eager to learn &quot;whence I came; how I</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">acquired those appearances of reason, which I discovered in all my</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">actions; and to know my story from my own mouth, which he hoped he</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">should soon do by the great proficiency I made in learning and</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">pronouncing their words and sentences.&quot; &nbsp;To help my memory, I</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">formed all I learned into the English alphabet, and writ the words</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">down, with the translations. &nbsp;This last, after some time, I</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">ventured to do in my master's presence. &nbsp;It cost me much trouble to</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">explain to him what I was doing; for the inhabitants have not the</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">least idea of books or literature.</FONT></div>
<bR>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">In about ten weeks time, I was able to understand most of his</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">questions; and in three months, could give him some tolerable</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">answers. &nbsp;He was extremely curious to know &quot;from what part of the</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">country I came, and how I was taught to imitate a rational</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">creature; because the Yahoos (whom he saw I exactly resembled in my</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">head, hands, and face, that were only visible), with some</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">appearance of cunning, and the strongest disposition to mischief,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">were observed to be the most unteachable of all brutes.&quot; &nbsp;I</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">answered, &quot;that I came over the sea, from a far place, with many</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">others of my own kind, in a great hollow vessel made of the bodies</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">of trees: &nbsp;that my companions forced me to land on this coast, and</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">then left me to shift for myself.&quot; &nbsp;It was with some difficulty,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">and by the help of many signs, that I brought him to understand me.</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">He replied, &quot;that I must needs be mistaken, or that I said the</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">thing which was not;&quot; for they have no word in their language to</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">express lying or falsehood. &nbsp;&quot;He knew it was impossible that there</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">could be a country beyond the sea, or that a parcel of brutes could</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">move a wooden vessel whither they pleased upon water. &nbsp;He was sure</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">no Houyhnhnm alive could make such a vessel, nor would trust Yahoos</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">to manage it.&quot;</FONT></div>
<bR>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">The word Houyhnhnm, in their tongue, signifies a HORSE, and, in its</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">etymology, the PERFECTION OF NATURE. &nbsp;I told my master, &quot;that I was</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">at a loss for expression, but would improve as fast as I could; and</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">hoped, in a short time, I should be able to tell him wonders.&quot; &nbsp;He</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">was pleased to direct his own mare, his colt, and foal, and the</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">servants of the family, to take all opportunities of instructing</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">me; and every day, for two or three hours, he was at the same pains</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">himself. &nbsp;Several horses and mares of quality in the neighbourhood</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">came often to our house, upon the report spread of &quot;a wonderful</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Yahoo, that could speak like a Houyhnhnm, and seemed, in his words</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">and actions, to discover some glimmerings of reason.&quot; &nbsp;These</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">delighted to converse with me: &nbsp;they put many questions, and</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">received such answers as I was able to return. &nbsp;By all these</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">advantages I made so great a progress, that, in five months from my</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">arrival I understood whatever was spoken, and could express myself</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">tolerably well.</FONT></div>

<bR>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">My master, after some expressions of great indignation, wondered</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">&quot;how we dared to venture upon a Houyhnhnm's back; for he was sure,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">that the weakest servant in his house would be able to shake off</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">the strongest Yahoo; or by lying down and rolling on his back,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">squeeze the brute to death.&quot; &nbsp;I answered &quot;that our horses were</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">trained up, from three or four years old, to the several uses we</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">intended them for; that if any of them proved intolerably vicious,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">they were employed for carriages; that they were severely beaten,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">while they were young, for any mischievous tricks; that the males,</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">designed for the common use of riding or draught, were generally</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">castrated about two years after their birth, to take down their</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">spirits, and make them more tame and gentle; that they were indeed</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">sensible of rewards and punishments; but his honour would please to</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">consider, that they had not the least tincture of reason, any more</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">than the Yahoos in this country.&quot;</FONT></div>
<bR>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">It put me to the pains of many circumlocutions, to give my master a</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">right idea of what I spoke; for their language does not abound in</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">variety of words, because their wants and passions are fewer than</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">among us. &nbsp;But it is impossible to express his noble resentment at</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">our savage treatment of the Houyhnhnm race; particularly after I</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">had explained the manner and use of castrating horses among us, to</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">hinder them from propagating their kind, and to render them more</FONT></div>

<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">to shnuwnh. &nbsp;The word is strongly expressive in their language, but</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">not easily rendered into English; it signifies, &quot;to retire to his</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">first mother.&quot; &nbsp;Her excuse for not coming sooner, was, that her</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">husband dying late in the morning, she was a good while consulting</FONT></div>
