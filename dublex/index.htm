      <h1>Dublex Introduction</h1>
      <p><i>Version 1.0.0 - 11/9/99</i></p>
      <p>Dublex is a langmaking game -- think of it as Scrabble for people who 
        like to invent words. Rather than the letter tiles of Scrabble, Dublex 
        has 400 word tiles. You combine the word tiles in as many ways as desired 
        to come up with new words. For instance:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <dl> 
          <dt><b>vocsist</b> /vohk-SEEST/ [voc+sist, "word system"]</dt>
          <dd>language -- a systematic means of communicating by the use of sounds 
            or conventional symbols</dd>
          <dt><b>jamadbin</b> /zhah-mahd-BEEN/ [jamad+bin, "frozen building"]</dt>
          <dd>igloo -- an Eskimo hut built of blocks (usu. sod or snow) in the 
            shape of a dome</dd>
          <dt><b>cafazmuh</b> /kah-fahz-MOOSH/ [cafaz+muh, "jumping rodent"]</dt>
          <dd>rabbit, bunny, coney, cony -- any of various burrowing animals of 
            the family Leporidae having long ears and short tails; some domesticated 
            and raised for pets and food</dd>
          <dt><b>pedmestser</b> /pehd-mehst-SEHR/ [ped+mest+ser, "foot place series"]</dt>
          <dd>stairs -- a means of access consisting of a series of steps</dd>
          <dt><b>cisdesir</b> /kees-deh-SEER/ [cis+desir, "story desire"]</dt>
          <dd>story hunger -- an emotional need for fulfillment through narrative 
            fiction in any form (book, television sitcom, movies, etc.)</dd>
        </dl>
      </blockquote>
      <p>You can coin as many words as you like. Most of the words will be compiled 
        into a dictionary and listed on the LangMaker.com web site. Whoever coins 
        the most listed words by January 1, 2000, will win a $100 gift certificate 
        to Amazon.com. The final judge of whether words are entered into the lexicon 
        is myself (though of course I plan on admitting most words).</p>
      <p>By submitting words and definitions to dublexgame@onelist.com, you are 
        agreeing to place those words in the public domain. The Dublex dictionary 
        that will be compiled and edited by myself will also be in the public 
        domain and will be a resource for anyone who wants it. I am planning on 
        writing a JavaScript application that will prompt you for a list of 400 
        words in your own conlang and will then suggest compounds for your language 
        using the dictionary. This will be a quick way for you to get more ideas 
        for words for your own language. Additionally, others in the langmaking 
        community are encouraged to come up with their own uses for the completed 
        Dublex dictionary.</p>
      <p>To participate in the contest, you must submit words and definitions 
        to dublexgame@onelist.com. You can subscribe to the list at <a href="https://www.onelist.com/subscribe/dublex">https://www.onelist.com/subscribe/dublex</a> 
        or by e-mailing <a href="mailto:dublex-subscribe@onelist.com">dublex-subscribe@onelist.com</a>. 
        Its a good idea to see other people's suggested words -- they may inspire 
        words of your own. However, you can easily set your subscription to "Web 
        Only" if you don't want to read other people's suggestions. If you don't 
        want to participate in the contest, but want to review the Dublex word 
        list and grammar, surf to <a href="https://www.onelist.com/files/dublexgame/">https://www.onelist.com/files/dublexgame/</a>.</p>
      <p>All word definitions must be provided in English, and you are encouraged 
        to adapt definitions from the <a href="https://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/webwn">WordNet 
        database</a>. It's also completely appropriate to invent words without 
        any English equivalents, such as 'cisdesir', "story hunger", above. Since 
        the game mailing list is open to the public, all definitions must avoid 
        obscenity; if you want to define words about copulation and excretion, 
        please use the Latinate vocabulary of English to do so.</p>
      <p>The heart and soul of the Dublex game is the Dublex language, the language 
        invented for the 400 word tiles. Once you subscribe to the mailing list, 
        you will be e-mailed the Dublex-English lexicon of root words.</p>
      <p>The name Dublex is a combination of 'dub' ("to give a name to facetiously 
        or playfully; to nickname") and 'lex' (from Greek 'lexis', "word", present 
        in English 'lexicon'). It's also a play on 'duplex' ("twofold; double") 
        since many of the Dublex words you can create have two parts: e.g., 'vocsist', 
        "word system = language"; 'sihbin', "health building = hospital"; and 
        'nassens', "nose sense = smell".</p>
      <h2>Solitaire Play</h2>
      <p>For solitaire play, choose any seven Dublex words at random, then begin 
        to combine them to form new words. See the Wordmaking rules below. The 
        object is to coin as many words as possible. You decide what the words 
        mean. It's just for fun, but if you want to compete with yourself, keep 
        track of how many words you can coin from any seven Dublex words and strive 
        to improve your personal best. It's not just 7 times 7 or 49 words, since 
        you can string more roots together ('vocsistlet', "language (diminutive) 
        = dialect"), apply four built-in infixes, create phrases and even create 
        acronyms ('vadap' = 'VAtDArtPart', "watery dirt part = mud part = brick"). 
        Please e-mail any words you define to <a href="dublex@langmaker.com">dublex@langmaker.com</a>, 
        if you are not a contestant in the Dublex game (if you are, please e-mail 
        to <a href="dublexgame@onelist.com">dublexgame@onelist.com</a>).</p>
      <h2>Two-Player Play</h2>
      <p>Two players each choose seven different Dublex words (at random or by 
        choice) and try to form the most words from them in a given time period 
        -- say, five minutes. The winner is the player with the most words coined.</p>
      <h2>Three-Or-More Play</h2>
      <p>When you have three or more players, there's an even better way to play 
        (come on, play Dublex with a few friends and spread the joy of conlanging!). 
        Choose seven Dublex root words at random. For five minutes, everyone tries 
        to coin words from these roots. When the five minutes are up, each player 
        reads his list. Any time two or more players have the same word form with 
        the same basic meaning, they each get one point. Whoever has the most 
        points wins the hand, and you can play up to 50 points a game. The goal 
        is to create as many consensus word compounds as possible with your fellow 
        players. Whoever succeeds in this best wins. In effect, you and your fellow 
        players are creating a common language together.</p>
      <h2>Contest</h2>
      <p>To spur initial interest in Dublex, I'm offering a US$100 gift certificate 
        to Amazon.com to the person who submits the most words to the <A href="dublexgame@onelist.com">dublexgame@onelist.com</a> 
        list before January 1st, 2000.</p>
      <h2>Pronounciation Guide</h2>
      <p>Dublex, as a language for use in a game, has a simplified sound system 
        that should be easy for you to learn.</p>
      <h3>Vowels</h3>
      <p>Dublex has just five vowels, each written by a single letter.</p>
      <p>
      <blockquote> a - as in 'father'<br>
        e - as in 'pet'<br>
        i - as in 'pizza'<br>
        o - as in 'Poe' or 'poet'<br>
        u - as in 'tutu' </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>Whenever two vowels occur together, they are pronounced as separate syllables: 
        'moap' ("male parent, father") is pronounced /moh-AHP/.</p>
      <h3>Consonants</h3>
      <pre>

            Voiceless               Voiced 

Stops       p - as in 'pot'         b - as in 'bought' 
            t - as in 'tot'         d - as in 'dot' 
            c /k/ - as in 'cot'     g - as in 'got' 

Fricatives  f - as in 'fought'      v - as in 'vote' 
            s - as in 'sought'      z - as in 'zit' 
            h /sh/ - as in 'shot'   j /zh/ - as in 'de jure' or 'pleasure' 

Liquids                             l - as in lap 
                                    r - as in rap 
                                    
Nasals                              m - as in map 
                                    n - as in nap 
</pre>
      <p>As an experienced English speaker, you will need to get use to the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The letter 'c' is always /k/. In English, 'c' has several different 
          sounds associated with it, the most common of which is /k/ as in 'cat' 
          and the next most common is /s/ as in 'city' or cent. In Latin, 'c' 
          was originally always pronounced /k/, but over time (certainly by the 
          time of Medieval Latin) 'c' came to be pronounced /s/ in front of /i/ 
          or /e/; English borrowed this pronounciation when it borrowed Latin 
          vocabulary. The Dublex way is simpler, but requires a bit of unlearning.</li>
        <li>The letter 'h' is always /sh/. This is odd, certainly, but Latin lacked 
          the /sh/ sound altogether and the 'sh' way of writing it was cobbled 
          together by Norman monks. Since the /h/ sound itself does not occur 
          in Dublex, this letter was adopted to represent /sh/. So when you see 
          the Dublex word 'hazar', "tree", remember that it is pronounced /shah-ZAHRR/.</li>
        <li>The letter 'j' is always /zh/ as in de jure. The /zh/ sound does occur 
          in English, but it written many different ways -- none of them 'zh'! 
          The regular /j/ sound, as in English 'just', is in fact actually a /d/ 
          sound followed by /zh/, a combination rarely permitted in other languages. 
          Since the /dzh/ (English 'j') combination isn't used in Dublex, the 
          letter 'j' has been pressed into service for /zh/ (which, like /sh/, 
          never occured in Latin).</li>
        <li>The letter 'r' is actually a trilled /r/ as in Spanish. If you pronounce 
          it as in English, though, your fellow Dublexians are not likely to be 
          bothered.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When consonants occur together in a Dublex word, you may -- if you find 
        pronouncing the consonant cluster difficult -- insert an indeterminate 
        vowel between the consonants. The indeterminate vowel or schwa is a mid-central 
        neutral vowel, typically occuring in unstressed syllables in English, 
        such as the final vowel in 'sofa'. Schwa insertion is something native 
        speakers of Polynesian languages and Chinese dialects will find especially 
        helpful, since consonant clusters do not occur in those languages. As 
        a speaker of English, you will need it less often than they would, but 
        may find it helpful when pronouncing words with doubled consonants: for 
        instance, 'vissens' /vees-SEHNS/ or /vee-s{e}-SEHNS/, where {e} represents 
        the schwa, typically represented as an upside-down lowercase letter e 
        or, in some ASCII notations, as the at sign, @.</p>
      <h3>Stress & Syllables</h3>
      <p>If a Dublex word ends in a consonant, its last syllable receives the 
        stress. If a word ends in a vowel, its next-to-last (penultimate) syllable 
        receives the stress. So 'comun' ("communication") is pronounced /koh-MOON/, 
        with the emphasis on the final syllable, and 'comunu' ("to communicate") 
        is pronounced /koh-MOO-noo/, with the emphasis on the penultimate syllable. 
        This keeps the basic sound of the root word the same, regardless of the 
        part-of-speech ending. (Please note that the final consonant always begins 
        the syllable with the part-of-speech ending.)</p>
      <h3>Part Of Speech Endings</h3>
      <p>The part of speech of almost all Dublex words (except for a few particles 
        not included in the 400 roots) is indicated by the final vowels, if any.</p>
      <pre>
unmarked - noun
-a       - noun modifier (adjective)
-e       - verb modifier (adverb)
-i       - multiword compound
-o       - preposition
-u       - verb
-ie      - adjective modifier (adverb)
-io      - clause modifier
</pre>
      <p>All Dublex roots are nouns.</p>
      <h3>Word Patterns</h3>
      <p>The most important goal in creating a lexicon for Dublex was to have 
        it always be obvious when a word is a compound form or a root form. To 
        this end, almost all Dublex words begin and end with consonants and exclude 
        consonant clusters from the beginning of syllables. So words are of forms 
        like CVC (Consonant-Vowel-Consonant) 'muh' /moosh/, "rodent"; CVVC 'poer' 
        /poh-EHR/, "man, male person"; CVCC 'sist' /seest/, "system"; CVCVC 'catoh' 
        /kah-TOSH/, "cat"; CVCVCC 'malact' /mah-LAHKT/, "milk" . A root like *plant 
        is not permitted, since initial consonant clusters are not allowed, and 
        the word 'campus' /kahm-POOS/ could not be a root but would be a compound 
        of the roots 'cam'+'pus' ("shirt" + "usage"). The word patterns make it 
        easy to tell where one root begins and one ends (for instance, 'duvsir' 
        is clearly 'duv'+'sir' and 'mentvoc' is clearly 'ment'+'voc'). Of course, 
        all final vowels make up their own morpheme, marking the part of speech 
        (for instance, 'vissensu' is 'vis'+'sens'+'u').</p>
      <p>While the word patterns ("morphotactics") of Dublex may seem artificial, 
        many languages have much greater restrictions on possible word forms than 
        English. For instance, Polynesian languages typically allow only V and 
        CV syllables; Chinese syllables are typically CV or CVC. This means that 
        when roots are borrowed into these languages, they undergo a lot of change, 
        such as when English 'pocket monster' becomes Japanese 'pokemon'. In Dublex, 
        English 'plant' (from Latin) is present as 'palt', since both *plant and 
        *palnt are invalid roots.</p>
      <p>Which brings us to the primary design tension of Dublex. On the one hand, 
        root words must fit strict syllable patterns, but on the other hand root 
        words should be as recognizable as possible to speakers of any language. 
        Since it was not feasible to analyze thousands of languages for common 
        forms, Dublex focused in on words from six of the most spoken languages 
        in the world: Arabic, Chinese, English, Hindi, Russian and Spanish (called 
        the six cardinal languages). The primary source of these natural-language 
        words was the Lojban etymological dictionary, which presented phonetic 
        information about over 1200 words. Where possible, forms in other languages 
        were also considered, especially forms in German, Dutch, Italian, Esperanto 
        and Novial, as derived from the Universal Language Dictionary.</p>
      <p>How recognizable are Dublex words? It is rare that you will have a Dublex 
        word like 'motor' /moh-TOHRR/, "motor", which -- as a technical term derived 
        from Latin -- has found its way into all the cardinal languages (though, 
        in Mandarin Chinese, it takes the form /mada/). More typical is something 
        like 'cafaz', "jump", from the Arabic /kafaz/, a form which won out because 
        it fit the word structure of Dublex best and because its initial /k-/ 
        was reinforced by Hindi /kud/. Matching the initial sound was considered 
        quite important, as it has been demonstrated to be a strong mnemonic, 
        and a high correspondence of word-initial sounds from Dublex to the speaker's 
        native tongue makes Dublex sound "more natural".</p>
      <p>While early attempts were made to systemize word formation, these methods 
        were rejected and it was done on ad hoc basis. The priority was to take 
        any form more or less as is, if it were present in two of the cardinal 
        languages. If it were a particular high-frequency form, it might be truncated 
        to one syllable, such as 'per' from Latin 'persona', extant in Romance 
        (Spanish, Italian, et al), Germanic (English, German, et al) and Russian, 
        and reinforced by Hindi /puruc/. If no forms matched, but some matched 
        on an initial letter, one of those forms was chosen.</p>
      <p>In some cases, conflicts with other words changed the available form: 
        'cat' in Dublex means "cut" as this form is supported in more cardinal 
        languages than the form 'cat' for "cat"; therefore something longer than 
        /kat/ was needed for "feline" and the selection was 'catoh', taking the 
        /-osh/ from Russian /koshk/, with the -ato- reinforced by the Romance 
        form 'gat(t)o'.</p>
      <p>While word forms could have been generated randomly by computer, looking 
        to natural languages for inspiration provided some needed realism to the 
        language -- and makes remembering the vocabulary a little easier, especially 
        for English speakers.</p>
      <h2>Wordmaking -- How To Combine Roots</h2>
      <p>You can coin new Dublex words using the following techniques:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Simple compounding</li>
        <li>Suffixing</li>
        <li>Applying infixes</li>
        <li>Coining phrases</li>
        <li>Forming acronyms</li>
      </ul>
      <dl> 
        <dt><b>Simple Compounding</b></dt>
        <dd>The simplest method of word creation is simply to place a modifier 
          before the word being modified. Thus 'darg'+'vic' = 'dargvic', "road 
          vehicle, car", and 'fon'+'sens' = 'fonsens', "sound sense, hearing". 
          You can string together as many compounds as is reasonable, as in 'lun'+'col'+'vic' 
          = 'luncolvic', "lunar wheeled vehicle, lunar rover". As a result, you 
          can incorporate other people's coined words into your own words.</dd>
        <dt><b>Suffixing</b></dt>
        <dd>A small set of Dublex words follow the word they modify. Most of these 
          are scalars, which are words that describe an end point on a scale, 
          such as 'term', "hot", and 'dens', "dense". So 'vattermmest', 'vat'+'term'+'mest', 
          is "hot water place, hot springs", and 'furtcisid' is 'furt'+'cisid', 
          "acidic fruit", which might refer to the lemon, lime or kumquat. All 
          the scalars are marked in the Dublex root-word dictionary. Five suffixes 
          that aren't scalars are 'ses', "female"; 'mas', "male"; 'ton', {augmentative}; 
          'let', {diminutive}; and 'con', "opposite". Sample words are 'tigerses', 
          "tigress"; 'bacarmas', "bull"; 'lunton', "full moon"; 'lunlet', "crescent 
          moon"; and 'succon', "unhappiness". The advantages of having a few of 
          the most common roots be suffixes including having alphabetical lists 
          with related terms close to one another (e.g., 'bacar', "bovine"; 'bacarmas', 
          "bull"; 'bacarses', "cow") and having clearer structure in words with 
          three or more roots.</dd>
        <dt><b>Applying Infixes</b></dt>
        <dd>Six of the most common suffixes can be inserted as infixes into the 
          last syllable of a root. For instance, the augmentative 'ton' has the 
          corresponding infix -u-, and the diminutive 'let' has the infix -a-. 
          So 'perton', "augmented person, giant", can be written 'puer', and 'perlet', 
          "diminutive person, dwarf", can be written 'paer'. The infixes -i- and 
          -o- have different meanings depending on whether or not the root modified 
          refers to a person or animal; if it does, then -i- indicates female, 
          'baciar', "female bovine, cow", and -o- indicates male, 'bacoar', "male 
          bovine, bull". If the word does not have animality, then -i- indicates 
          opposite, 'lium', "light opposite, darkness", and -o- indicates abstraction, 
          'loum', "light abstraction, luminosity". The infix -e- is used when 
          the infix matches the final vowel of the root, so *luun is invalid, 
          with the correct form being 'leun', "full moon".</dd>
        <dt><b>Coining Phrases</b></dt>
        <dd>English and many languages have set phrases, called idioms, whose 
          meaning is not obvious from the words used. For example, the White House 
          is not just a house that is white. Dublex phrases are formed using the 
          part-of-speech marker -i, which means, in effect, that this word idiomatically 
          modifies the word after it, so "White House" might be 'nieri fambin', 
          "white(black+opposite)+{idiom} house(family+building)". You can also 
          simply write this 'nierfambin', of course, but marking words as idiomatic 
          modifiers is useful for indicating the scope of a modifier: 'nieri', 
          "white", clearly modifies 'fambin', "house", where 'nierfambin' could 
          be read as "white family's building" or "white family-building".</dd>
        <dt><b>Forming Acronyms</b></dt>
        <dd>Really long phrases or words can be truncated into acronyms. For instance, 
          'vatdartpart', "watery dirt part = mud part = brick", could be shorted 
          to 'vadapart' or 'vadap' ('VAtDArtPart'). The rule for forming acronyms 
          is that you use only the CV from each word except the last word, which 
          you can either append in full (as in 'vadapart') or truncate to the 
          initial consonant (as in 'vadap'). However, acronyms can't conflict 
          with one of the 400 roots or 3 pronouns ('von', 'nin' and 'tan', the 
          first-, second- and third-person pronouns, respectively); therefore, 
          'voltdarg', "electric road, monorail", can be shortened to 'vod', which 
          is a root meaning "body of water", but would have to be shortened to 
          'vodarg'.</dd>

        <dt>Ray Brown</dt>
        <dd>Thanks to Ray for his suggestions for simplying the sound system of 
          Dublex, specifically his critism of separate /w/ and /v/ sounds, of 
          the presence of the /h/ sound, and of using the digraph 'ch' to represent 
          /sh/. Inspired by this, /w/ and /h/ and /y/ were eliminated and 'h' 
          was instead used for /sh/.</dd>
