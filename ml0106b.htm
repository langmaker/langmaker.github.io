      <HR>
      <H2><A NAME="BM2">Sidebar: relative terms for relatives</A> </H2>
      <P> Kinship terms have been widely analyzed across languages, which often 
        make quite different distinctions. We broke English kinship terms down 
        into Generation, Sex and Lineage earlier, but to translate terms from 
        other languages we will need to add additional semantic components. 
      <P> We will outline <EM>KinDEEP</EM> (KINship Distinctive Elements, Exhaustive 
        Profile) here, a detailed framework for defining kinship terms from different 
        languages. <EM>KinDEEP</EM> has semantic components for Generation, Lineage, 
        Sex, Side Of Family, Relative Birth Order and Person. 
      <HR>
      <H2><A NAME="BM2a">Generations</A> </H2>
      <P> The value for Generation is any number, with 0 indicating the base or 
        current generation, negative numbers indicating ancestors of the base 
        generation, and positive numbers indicating descendants. 
      <P> One of the more unusual kinship terms in the world is <EM>maili</EM>, 
        from Njamal, an Australian aborigine language. The word <EM>maili</EM> 
        means &quot;any relative two generations distant&quot;, such as a father's 
        father (two generations before) or a daughter's son's wife's sister (two 
        generations after). <EM>KinDEEP</EM> expresses this as simply {Generation: 
        +2}{Generation: -2}. 
      <HR>
      <H2><A NAME="BM2b">Lineage</A> </H2>
      <P> As described in the <A href="ml0106a.htm">main article</A>, Lineage 
        can be either Direct, Colineal or Ablineal. 
      <HR>
      <H2><A NAME="BM2c">Sex</A> </H2>
      <P> Sex is either Male, Female or Corresponding. 
      <P> The atom Corresponding is necessary to analyze some Hawaiian terms. 
        For instance, the Hawaiian word <EM>kaikaina</EM> means &quot;younger 
        sibling of the same sex as the referent&quot;. So a man's <EM>kaikaina</EM> 
        would be his younger brother; a woman's <EM>kaikaina</EM> would be her 
        younger sister. 
      <HR>
      <H2><A NAME="BM2d">Side of family</A> </H2>
      <P> Languages often make distinctions between the sides of a family, such 
        as maternal, paternal, <EM>step-</EM> and <EM>half-</EM>. The semantic 
        component of Side of Family can take any of these values: {Maternal}, 
        {Paternal}, {Step}, {Half} and {Honorary}. 
      <UL>
        <LI><A href="ml0106b.htm#2d1">Maternal/paternal</A> 
        <LI><A href="ml0106b.htm#2d2">The family's dark side</A> 
        <LI><A href="ml0106b.htm#2d3">The family's bright side</A> 
      </UL>
      <HR width=75%>
      <H3><A NAME="BM2d1">Maternal/paternal</A> </H3>
      <P> One difference might be as simple as distinguishing between a mother's 
        brother and a father's brother, as Latin and many other European languages 
        do. Latin has two different words for &quot;uncle&quot; depending on the 
        exact relationship, <EM>avunculus</EM> for &quot;mother's brother&quot; 
        and <EM>patruus</EM> for &quot;father's brother&quot;. Thus Latin lacks 
        one word to collectively describe what we think of as &quot;uncle&quot; 
        (how did schoolchildren cry &quot;surrender!&quot; we wonder?) or -- for 
        that matter -- &quot;aunt&quot;. Like Old French, other Romance languages 
        lost this distinction, adopting the maternal terms to refer to either 
        side of the family; thus, Modern French has <EM>oncle</EM> and <EM>tante</EM>, 
        which were adopted into English as <EM>uncle</EM> and <EM>aunt</EM> respectively, 
        displacing the Old English tradition of referring to this generation as 
        &quot;father's brother&quot;, &quot;mother's sister&quot;, etc. 
      <P> Just as Latin has no single words for either &quot;uncle&quot; or &quot;aunt&quot;, 
        Swedish has no single words equivalent to either &quot;grandmother&quot; 
        or &quot;grandfather&quot;, but must specify which side of the family 
        the relationship is through. Swedish does this concisely, using <EM>far</EM> 
        to mean &quot;father&quot;, <EM>mor</EM> to mean &quot;mother&quot;, for: 
      <UL>
        <LI><EM>mormor</EM>, &quot;mother's mother, maternal grandmother&quot; 
        <LI><EM>farmor</EM>, &quot;father's mother, paternal grandmother&quot; 
        <LI><EM>morfar</EM>, &quot;mother's father, maternal grandfather&quot; 
        <LI><EM>farfar</EM>, &quot;father's father, paternal grandfather&quot; 
      </UL>
      <P> Interestingly, however, Swedish does not use <EM>mor</EM> and <EM>far</EM> 
        by themselves for &quot;mother&quot; and &quot;father&quot; respectively, 
        using <EM>moder</EM> and <EM>fader</EM> for that instead. No sense taking 
        logic to far in a natural language! (I am not aware of any other European 
        language that distinguishes between maternal and paternal grandparents.) 
      <HR width=75%>
      <H3><A NAME="BM2d2">The family's dark side</A> </H3>
      <P> Besides referring to the maternal or paternal side of a family, it is 
        also possible to refer to other blood distinctions, especially those regarding 
        re-marriage. English uses the prefix <EM>step-</EM> to refer to relatives 
        related only by re-marriage, not blood, as in the <EM>evil stepmother</EM> 
        (which is not redundant) and the <EM>ungrateful stepdaughter</EM>, for 
        instance. English uses the suffix <EM>-in-law</EM> to refer to relatives 
        related by marriage, as in the <EM>evil mother-in-law</EM> and the <EM>ungrateful 
        daughter-in-law</EM>. When all this familial love becomes too much to 
        bear, English uses <EM>ex-</EM> in front of many or all the other terms, 
        so that you can refer to your <EM>ex-husband</EM>, your <EM>ex-stepdaughter</EM>, 
        your <EM>ex-mother- in-law</EM>, even your <EM>ex-great-grandfather-in-law</EM>. 
        But you're not likely to hear the terms <EM>ex-mother</EM> or <EM>ex-brother</EM> 
        to describe estranged relatives... 
      <P> English also uses the prefix <EM>half-</EM> to refer to children who 
        share only one parent (<EM>half-brother</EM> and <EM>half-sister</EM>) 
        but the term is not used to refer to other relatives (no <EM>*half-mother</EM>, 
        <EM>*half-grandson</EM>). 
      <HR width=75%>
      <H3><A NAME="BM2d3">The family's bright side</A> </H3>
      <P> Families often have unofficial members, as English recognizes by encouraging 
        the use of <EM>Aunt</EM> and <EM>Uncle</EM> for close family friends of 
        the same generation as a child's parents. I have an Uncle Bill and Aunt 
        Jill, close friends of my parents' from their college days, who were the 
        only honorary parentsibs that I had. To support this almost metaphoric 
        use of <EM>Aunt</EM> and <EM>Uncle</EM>, <EM>KinDEEP</EM> uses the value 
        {Honorary} as part of the semantic component of Side Of Family. 
      <HR>
      <H2><A NAME="BM2e">Relative birth order</A> </H2>
      <P> Japanese also makes distinctions of another variety, distinguishing 
        between younger and elder siblings. For instance, <EM>ane</EM>, &quot;older 
        sister&quot;; <EM>ani</EM>, &quot;older brother&quot;; <EM>oto/to</EM>, 
        &quot;younger brother&quot;; <EM>imo/to</EM>, &quot;younger sister&quot;. 
        Of course, these words also have first- and second-person forms. 
      <P> In total, therefore, Japanese has six words for &quot;brother&quot;, 
        with separate words making the following distinctions: 
      <UL>
        <LI>&quot;older brother&quot; 
        <LI>&quot;younger brother&quot; 
        <LI>&quot;my older brother&quot; 
        <LI>&quot;my younger brother&quot; 
        <LI>&quot;your older brother&quot; 
        <LI>&quot;your younger brother&quot; 
      </UL>
      <P> <EM>KinDEEP</EM> has the semantic component {Relative Birth Order}, 
        with values for {Older} and {Younger}. 
      <P> In natural languages, this distinction is almost always used for siblings, 
        but <EM>KinDEEP</EM> extends it for the common siblings of any generation, 
        making it easy to express terms such as &quot;younger uncle&quot;, for 
        instance. 
      <HR>
      <H2><A NAME="BM2f">Person</A> </H2>
      <P> The Japanese are strongly oriented around family and ancestry, and accordingly 
        their language is richer in kinship terms than English. One of the distinctions 
        Japanese makes is that it has separate forms for &quot;my relative&quot; 
        and &quot;your or other's relatives&quot;. For instance, <EM>mago</EM> 
        is &quot;my grandson&quot;; <EM>omagosan</EM> is &quot;your grandson&quot;. 
        Think of this as a combination pronoun/kinship term, with the term specifying 
        either first person (&quot;my&quot;) or second person (&quot;your&quot;). 
        All of Japanese' second-person forms end in the <EM>-san</EM> suffix or 
        a variant of it. The base word may be different, as in <EM>haha</EM> for 
        &quot;my mother&quot; but <EM>oka/san</EM> for &quot;your mother&quot; 
        (rather than <EM>*hahasan</EM>). 
      <P> Therefore, <EM>KinDEEP</EM> recognizes the semantic component Person, 
        with values of {First} and {Second}. It would be easy to suggest a third-person 
        form -- e.g., &quot;their mother&quot; -- but I am not aware of any language 
        that makes this distinction. 
      <HR>
      <H2><A NAME="BM2g">Kindeep examples</A> </H2>
      <P> The following table provides a framework to present the kinship terms 
        of many different languages. If you have a term from a language that does 
        not fit, please pass it on! 
      <P> When you create your own model language, you can decide which components 
        you want to include. A typical minimal profile involves just three components, 
        as in English's use of Generation, Lineage and Sex, though it is easy 
        to imagine a language that does not distinguish between terms based on 
        sex. 
      <P> <EM>KinDEEP</EM> (KINship Distinctive Elements, Exhaustive Profile) 
        is actually exhausting, rather than exhaustive! For instance, it fails 
        to have terms that have been enabled by reproductive science: the womb-mother 
        (she carried the child of another in her womb), the egg-donor (she provided 
        the egg that was fertilized and carried by the womb-mother), the caretaker-mother 
        who actually raised the child but was not biologically related, the sperm 
        donor and caretaker-father!

        designed to fulfill the role of an interlanguage for use by people of 
        all the world's linguistic backgrounds, I chose a maximally expressive

        Sen:esepera, if that is the term he is most comfortable with, while a

        <EM>fem:u:ta</EM> in Sen:esepera, if that is the term she is most comfortable 
        with. The word <EM>fem:u:ta</EM> will stand out to the English-speaker 
        reading Sen:esepera, who does not habitually make the distinction of sex 
        for cousin, but he will immediately know the meaning of the word.
