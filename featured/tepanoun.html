<H2><A NAME="phase">Phase</A></H2>
<P>The most fundamental distinction marked in the grammar of Tepa is
that of phase. Both nouns and verbs can be marked for either bound or
unbound phase. The prosodic cue for bound phase is a final heavy
syllable, while that for unbound phase is a final light syllable.
Nouns in Tepa which are unbound in phase are semantically indefinite
in reference, while nouns which are bound in phase are semantically
definite in reference. Some examples are given in (1):</P>
<PRE>
(1)    UNBOUND                    BOUND
        neqa 'woman, a woman'      neqaa 'the woman'
        peke 'bone, a bone'        pekee 'the bone'
        tawitu 'horn, a horn'      tawituu 'the horn'
        anki 'fish, a fish'        ankii 'the fish'</PRE>
<H2><A NAME="number">Number</A></H2>
<P>Nouns in Tepa are marked for paucal and two kinds of plural:
distributive and collective. Singular nouns remain umarked. Below I
discuss the formation of these number categories.</P>
<H3><A NAME="paucal">Paucal</A></H3>
<P>Only the final two syllables of a root are involved in the
formation of number categories; these two syllables as a unit are
referred to as the 'base'. To form the paucal stem, the initial CV
sequence of the base is copied and prefixed to the base. For nouns
which are unbound in phase, the second to last vowel is then deleted.
For nouns which are bound in phase, the final vowel is lengthened.
This is illustrated below with the roots /pite/ 'eye' and /palata/
'leaf'.</P>
<PRE>
(2)         UNBOUND                 BOUND
/pite/      pipte [pifte]           pipitee [piviDee]
/palata/    palalta [paralda]       palalataa [pararaDaa]</PRE>
<P>Semantically, the paucal refers to a small collection of objects
which can be grouped together. For objects normally occuring in
pairs, the paucal is understood as a dual; thus, <I>pipte</I> is best
translated as 'a pair of eyes'.</P>
<H3><A NAME="distributive">Distributive</A></H3>
<P>The distributive plural is formed by suffixing a copy of the base
to itself. For unbound phase, the second to last vowel is deleted,
and for bound phase, the final vowel is lengthened.</P>
<PRE>
(3)         UNBOUND                 BOUND
/pite/      pitepte [piDefte]       pitepitee [piDeviDee]
/palata/    palatalta [paraDalda]   palatalataa [paraDaraDaa]</PRE>
<P>Semantically, the distributive plural denotes 7 or 8 objects or
more where a state or event is predicated of each object
individually, rather than of the collection as a whole. Thus a
distributive reading of the sentence 'The men were running around.'
denotes that each individual man was running around independently of
the others.</P>
<H3><A NAME="collective">Collective</A></H3>
<P>The collective plural is formed by infixing a /k/ before the final
syllable of the base for unbound phase. For bound phase, a sequence
of /k/ and a copy of the rhyme (everything after the onset in the
syllable) of the base-initial syllable is inserted before the final
syllable of the base; the final vowel is lengthened.</P>
<PRE>
(4)         UNBOUND                 BOUND
/pite/      pikte [pixte]           pikitee [pi3iDee]
/palata/    palakta [paraxta]       palakataa [para3aDaa]</PRE>
<P>Semantically, the collective plural denotes 7 or 8 objects or more
where a state or event is predicated of the group as a collection,
implying some kind of internal structure or coherence to the group.
This is especially common when referring to a group of animals, and
thus serves the same function as English expressions such as 'a flock 
of' or 'a herd of'.</P>
<H3><A NAME="exceptionsi">Exceptions I: Monosyllabic Roots</A></H3>
<P>Monosyllabic roots form a large class of exceptions to the rules
describing the formation of the number categories. There are two
basic types of monosyllabic roots: 1) CV roots, and 2) CVX roots,
where X is a consonant or vowel. For both types of monosyllabic
roots, there is no distinction between bound and unbound phase in
forms not marked for number (i.e. singular forms). Thus, [tuu]
(&lt;/tu/) can be either 'the dog' or 'a dog', and [pee~] (&lt;/pen/)
can be either 'the child' or 'a child'. Forms inflected for number do
distinguish between bound and unbound phase. Forms for paucal and
distributive plural are homophonous for monosyllabic roots.</P>
<P>CV roots: Since there is a prohibition in the language on words
consisting of only a single light syllable, CV roots are lengthened
in speech (and in the orthography) to CVV. To form the paucal or
distributive plural, the root is first copied. For unbound phase, the
medial consonant is geminated (doubled), and for bound phase, the
final vowel is lengthened; this is illustrated with the roots /tu/
'dog' and /ye/ 'egg'.</P>
<PRE>
(5)         UNBOUND                 BOUND
/tu/        tuttu [tuttu]           tutuu [tuDuu]
/ye/        yeyye [yeyye]           yeyee [yeyee]</PRE>
<P>To form the collective plural of CV roots, the rule given in
3.2.3. applies to this reduplicated form:</P>
<PRE>
(6)         UNBOUND                 BOUND
/tu/        tuktu [tuxtu]           tukutuu [tu3uDuu]
/ye/        yekye [ye3ye]           yekeyee [ye3eyee]</PRE>
<P>CVX roots: The second type of monosyllabic roots are those roots
which contain a long vowel, diphthong, or are closed by /n/; the
cover symbol 'X' represents the second part of the long vowel, the
glide of the diphthong and final /n/. The following schema
illustrates the formation of the paucal or distributive plural of
these roots:</P>
<PRE>
(7)    ROOT        UNBOUND           BOUND
        /CVX/       CVXCV             CVCVX</PRE>
<P>This is demonstrated below with the roots /tee/ 'foot', /lei/
'star' and /pen/ 'child'.</P>
<PRE>
(8)         UNBOUND                 BOUND
/tee/       teete [teeDe]           tetee [teDee]
/lei/       leile [leire]           lelei [lerei]
/pen/       penpe [pembe]           pepen [pevee~]</PRE>
<P>The collective plural is formed according to the following schema:</P>
<PRE>
(9)    ROOT        UNBOUND           BOUND
        /CVX/       CVXkV             CVkVX</PRE>
<P>This is demonstrated below with /tee/, /lei/ and /pen/.</P>
<PRE>
(10)        UNBOUND                 BOUND
/tee/       teeke [tee3e]           tekee [te3ee]
/lei/       leike [lei3e]           lekei [le3ei]
/pen/       penke [peqge]           peken [pe3ee~]</PRE>
<H3><A NAME="exceptionsii">Exceptions II: Roots with Penultimate
Heavy Syllables</A></H3>
<P>Roots with a penultimate heavy syllable are the second class of
exceptions to the regular number inflection rules given in 3.1. These
roots are exceptional in their formation of the unbound distributive
plural. Whereas the regular distributive plural formation involves
the suffixation of the entire base to the base, for roots with
penultimate heavy syllables only copy the final -XCV as a suffix.
Schematically this is:</P>
<PRE>
(11)  CVXCV-XCV</PRE>
<P>where 'X' is a cover symbol for vowel length, a glide, or /n/.
This is demonstrated for the root /sunpa/ 'belly'.</P>
<PRE>
(12)  /sunpa/ -&gt; sunpa-npa [sumbamba]</PRE>
<P>As in 3.1., lengthening the final vowel gives the bound phase form:</P>
<PRE>
(13)  /sunpa/ -&gt; sunpanpaa [sumbambaa].</PRE>
<H2><A NAME="possession">Possession</A></H2>
<P>Nouns may also be marked for possession. This marking indicates
the grammatical person of the possessor. The possessive prefixes
are:</P>
<PRE>
(14)  wa-  'first person'
        ku-  'second person'
        ne-  'third person'</PRE>
<P>Note that there is no distinction in number for the possessor;
that is, possession by a single first person is not marked
differently on the noun from possession by a non-singular first
person. Possessed nouns will always be bound in phase, since they are
always definite in reference. Adding a possessive prefix to a CV root
creates a disyllabic form which is inflected for number as shown
above. This is illustrated below with the root /tu/ 'dog'.</P>
<PRE>
(15)  watuu  'my/our dog'
        wawatuu  'my/our dog:PAUC'
        watuwatuu  'my/our dogs:DIST'
        wakatuu  'my/our dogs:COLL'</PRE>
