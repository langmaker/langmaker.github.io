<H2><A NAME="vphase">Phase</A></H2>

<P>Just as with nouns, verbs in Tepa are marked for phase. For verbs, 
the semantic correlate of bound phase is perfective aspect, while the 
semantic correlate of unbound phase is imperfective aspect. This 
distinction is marked in the same way on verbs as it is on nouns; 
that is, a final heavy syllable marks bound phase, while a final 
light syllable marks unbound phase.</P>

<H2><A NAME="arg">Argument Structure</A></H2>

<P>Verbs in Tepa contain very specific information concerning the 
arguments involved in a particular event or state of affairs, even 
though agreement morphology does not operate in the familiar sense. 
Predicates are grouped into three types depending on the number of 
obligatory arguments: 1) intransitive and stative predicates, which 
require at most one argument; 2) transitive predicates, which require 
two arguments; and 3) ditransitive predicates, which require three 
arguments. In the sections which follow, I will discuss each 
predicate type in turn.</P>

<H3><A NAME="preds">Intransitive and Stative Predicates</A></H3>

<P>Intransitive and stative predicates require at most one argument. 
This argument is marked on the verb by a prefix which varies with the 
grammatical person of the argument. These prefixes are:</P>
<PRE>
(1)	wa-  'first person'
	ku-  'second person'
	0-  'third person'
</PRE>
<H3><A NAME="trans">Transitive Predicates</A></H3>

<P>Transitive predicates can be described in terms of four relations 
between arguments and three operators which act on these relations. 
The four relations involved are:</P>
<PRE>
(2)	second person acting on first person (2&gt;1)
	second person acting on third person (2&gt;3)
	first person acting on third person (1&gt;3)
	third person acting on different third person (3&gt;3')
</PRE>
<P>Each relation has a particular prefix associated with it; these 
prefixes are homophonous with (and have the same origin as) the 
intransitive and stative prefixes (with the exception of _le-_ 2>1, 
which isn't available with an intransitive or stative predicate), but 
their semantic content is different because of the nature of the 
predicate to which they attach:</P>
<PRE>
(3)	le-  2&gt;1
	ku-  2&gt;3
	wa-  1&gt;3
	0-  3&gt;3'
</PRE>
<P>Conflating these relations gives the person hierarchy:</P>
<PRE>
(4)	2&gt;1&gt;3&gt;3'
</PRE>
<P>The three operators which act on these relations are: 1) direct, 
where relations proceed in the order specified in the person 
hierarchy; 2) inverse, where the person hierarchy is reversed (i.e. 
3'&gt;3&gt;1&gt;2); and 3) reflexive, where the second term of the 
direct relation is replaced by a second occurrence of the first term. 
These operators are each associated with a particular verbal grade, 
and will be discussed in the section on <A HREF="#grade">verbal 
grades</A>.</P>

<H3><A NAME="ditrans">Ditransitive Predicates</A></H3>

<P>It is easiest to think of the arguments of ditransitive predicates 
in terms of an "argument chain."  The head of the chain is the 
argument instigating the action (the agent) and the tail of the chain 
is the affected argument (the patient or theme). The third argument 
is an intermediate member of the chain and indicates location, goal, 
benefactive, or instrument. The prefixes are the same as those for 
transitive predicates, and only encode the relation between agent and 
patient; the intermediate argument does not enter into this 
grammatical relationship, but is expressed as an object following the 
verb, or as a pronominal clitic attached to the right edge of the 
inflected verb.</P>

<H2><A NAME="grade">Verbal Grades</A></H2>

<P>There are three verbal grades in Tepa; they correspond to the 
operators discussed above in <A HREF="#trans">Transitive 
Predicates</A>. They are: 1) normal grade, 2) l-grade, and 3) 
geminate grade. The formation of the l-grade and the geminate grade 
is defined on a base derived from the verbal root. This base is 
optimally disyllabic; for disyllabic roots, the root itself is taken 
to be the base. For roots of more than two syllables, the final two 
syllables are taken as the base. There are verb roots in which the 
final syllable has no onset. In these roots, the first syllable 
invariably contains a high vowel; the non-syllabic version of this 
high vowel provides the onset for the final syllable in forming the 
base.</P>
<PRE>
(5)	ROOT               BASE
	tepa 'speak'      [tepa]
	lua 'lie'         [luwa]
	kea 'flow'        [keja]
</PRE>
<P>As with nouns, monosyllabic roots are an important class of 
exceptions to base formation. For roots consisting only of a single 
light syllable, this syllable is reduplicated to form the base:</P>
<PRE>
(6)	ROOT               BASE
	ti 'be small'     [titi]
</PRE>
<P>For heavy monosyllables, a copy of the vowel is repeated after the 
coda; this forces the coda to become an onset for a second syllable. 
This is illustrated below:</P>
<PRE>
(7)	ROOT               BASE
	pai 'dig'         [pa.ya]
	nen 'live'        [ne.ne]
</PRE>
<H3><A NAME="normal">Normal Grade</A></H3>

<P>The normal grade of the verb indicates that the argument relations 
required by the verb proceed in the order of the argument hierarchy; 
that is, 2&gt;1&gt;3&gt;3'. Thus, translating the following sentences 
would involve a verb in the normal grade:</P>
<PRE>
(8)	You tickled me. (2&gt;1)
	You were kissing him. (2&gt;3)
	I saw my brother. (1&gt;3)
	The cat ate the mouse. (3&gt;3')
</PRE>
<P>The normal grade of a verb which is unbound in phase is equivalent 
to the root. Since some of these roots cosist only of a single light 
syllable, the vowel will be lengthened to conform with the minimal 
word requirement:</P>
<PRE>
(9)	ROOT              NORMAL GRADE (unbound)
	tepa 'speak'          tepa
	taleka 'hunt'         taleka
	lua 'lie'             lua
	pai 'dig'             pai
	nen 'live'            nen
	ti 'be small'         tii
</PRE>
<P>The bound phase forms are derived from the base by lengthening the 
final vowel of the base. This is illustrated below for the roots 
given in (9).</P>
<PRE>
(10)	ROOT         BASE        NORMAL GRADE (bound)
	tepa        [te.pa]          tepaa
	taleka      [le.ka]          talekaa
	lua         [lu.wa]          luwaa
	pai         [pa.ya]          payaa
	nen         [ne.ne]          nenee
	ti          [ti.ti]          titii
</PRE>
<H3><A NAME="lgrade">L-Grade</A></H3>

<P>The l-grade can also be called the inverse grade. A verb in the 
l-grade indicates that its arguments are in the reverse order of the 
argument heirarchy; that is, 3'&gt;3&gt;1&gt;2. Some sentences which 
would be translated by an l-grade verb in Tepa are:</P>
<PRE>
(11)	I tickled you. (1&gt;2)
	He was kissing you. (3&gt;2)
	My brother saw me. (3&gt;1)
	The mouse was eaten by the cat. (3&gt;3')
</PRE>
<P>There is some pragmatic force in the use of the l-grade for third 
person arguments, which I have indicated by using a passive sentence. 
It should be stressed, however, that the l-grade is not a passive, 
and that Tepa does not have a passive.</P>

<P>The formation of the l-grade is analogous to the formation of 
collective plurals for nouns. For unbound phase, an /l/ is inserted 
before the final syllable of the base. For bound phase, a sequence of 
/l/ and a copy of the rhyme of the base-initial syllable is inserted 
before the final syllable of the base; the final vowel is 
lengthened.</P>
<PRE>
(12)        UNBOUND                 BOUND
/tepa/      telpa [telba]           telepaa [terevaa]
/taleka/    talelka [tarelga]       talelekaa [tarere3aa]
</PRE>
<H3><A NAME="geminate">Geminate Grade</A></H3>

<P>The geminate grade signifies that the arguments of a transitive 
verb are not distinct from each other. This need not always indicate 
a reflexive, although the reflexive is the most common interpretation 
of a verb in the geminate grade.</P>

<P>The formal characteristic of the geminate grade is the geminate 
consonant which occurs medially in the base. After gemination, the 
bound phase is formed by lengthening the final vowel:</P>
<PRE>
(13)        UNBOUND                 BOUND
/tepa/      teppa [teppa]           teppaa [teppaa]
/taleka/    talekka [tarekka]       talekkaa [tarekkaa]
</PRE>
<H2><A NAME="number">Verbal Number</A></H2>

<P>Verbs with argument prefixes as the only indication of argument 
structure are also inflected for number in a manner analogous to 
number marking of nouns. Ambiguity arises in these cases since there 
is no indication of the number of subject or object.</P>
<PRE>
(14)	0-    puplu
	3>3'- pick:PAUC
	'They picked it.' or 'He picked some.'

(15)	0-    puluplu
	3>3'- pick:DIST
	'They picked it.' or 'He picked a lot.'
</PRE>
When overt noun phrases accompany a verb as arguments, the verb is 
not marked for number.
<PRE>
(16)	0-    pulu huhma      nemaa
	3>3'  pick fruit:PAUC man:B
	'The man picked some fruit.'

(17)	0-    pulu humahma    nemaa
	3>3'  pick fruit:DIST man:B
	'The man picked a lot of fruit.'
