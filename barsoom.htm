      <h2><a name="Background"></a>Background</h2>
      <p>John Carter was the first human in history to visit Mars. His travels 
        and those of his compatriots have been recorded in Edgar Rice Burrough's 
        11 volumes about Barsoom, as the natives call the Red Planet. These books 
        include: </p>
      <ol>
        <li><i>A Princess Of Mars</i> </li>
        <li><i>The Gods Of Mars</i> </li>
        <li><i>The Warlord Of Mars</i> </li>
        <li><i>Thuvia, Maid Of Mars</i> </li>
        <li><i>The Chessmen Of Mars</i> </li>
        <li><i>The Mastermind Of Mars</i> </li>
        <li><i>Fighting Man Of Mars</i> </li>
        <li><i>Swords Of Mars</i> </li>
        <li><i>Synthetic Men Of Mars</i> </li>
        <li><i>Llana Of Gathol</i> </li>
        <li><i>John Carter Of Mars</i> </li>
      </ol>
      <p>The following descriptions of the Barsoomian language were recorded by 
        Captain John Carter in <i>A Princess Of Mars:</i> </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&quot;This power [telepathy] is wonderfully developed in all Martians, 
          and accounts largely for the simplicity of their language and the relatively 
          few spoken words exchanged even in long conversations. It is the universal 
          language of Mars, through the medium of which the higher and lower animals 
          of this world of paradoxes are able to communicate to a greater or less 
          extent, depending upon the intellectual sphere of the species and the 
          development of the individual.&quot; </p>
        <p>&quot;The Martian language, as I have said, is extremely simple, and 
          in a week I could make all my wants known and understand nearly everything 
          that was said to me. Likewise, under Sola's tutelage, I developed my 
          telepathic powers so that I shortly could sense practically everything 
          that went on around me.&quot; </p>
        <p>&quot;'In the name of my first ancestor, then,' she continued, 'where 
          may you be from? You are like unto my people, and yet so unlike. You 
          speak my language, and yet I heard you tell Tars Tarkas that you had 
          but learned it recently. All Barsoomians speak the same tongue from 
          the ice-clad south to the ice-clad north, though their written languages 
          differ. Only in the valley Dor, where the river Iss empties into the 
          lost sea of Korus, is there supposed to be a different language spoken, 
          and, except in the legends of our ancestors, there is no record of a 
          Barsoomian returning up the river Iss.'&quot; </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>These excerpts, excepting a few others that repeat information shown 
        in these, are all the direct comments we have concerning the nature of 
        Barsoomian. Captain Carter's failure to explore these matters in more 
        depth indicates his lack of linguistic background; he did not realize 
        how unusual Barsoomian was compared to Earth languages. Barsoomian differs 
        in the following main ways: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The language is closely tied to telepathy. Words can either be telepathically 
          projected or spoken, with the majority of words apparently projected 
          (Carter writes &quot;relatively few spoken words [are] exchanged even 
          in long conversations&quot;). </li>
        <li>The language has a strong biological basis (no doubt tied to the telepathic 
          capability), being known across species and races of men. Where on Earth 
          <i>homo sapiens</i> is the only species to develop linguistic capabilities, 
          Barsoomians apparently first developed a language long ago in a primal 
          species; this capability has then evolved while maintaining compability 
          across species. (Little is known about the language of Dor.) </li>
        <li>The language changes slowly. Given that the different races are separated 
          by vast distances and had in many cases become isolated from one another, 
          yet still speak the same language, it is clear that some influence - 
          probably biological - keeps the language from changing at the same pace 
          as the languages of Earth humans. One factor in this conservatism has 
          to be the long lifespans of the races of Martian men, who can live up 
          to a thousand years if not killed in battle. If Earthly humans lived 
          on average a thousand years (compared to the average of 20 years at 
          the time of Christ), Terran languages <i>might </i>have changed 50 times 
          slower than they did (1000 divided by 20 = 50). </li>
        <li>The Barsoomian language can be learned very quickly. While this was 
          no doubt exaggerated for convenience of the narrative, the grammar and 
          vocabulary must be significantly more regular than most Earth languages. 
          <br>
          <br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2><a name="Phonologu"></a>Phonology And Orthography</h2>
      <p>Because the only field notes we have for Barsoomian came from a soldier 
        who was untrained in linguistics, we do not have an accurate understanding 
        of how Barsoomian is pronounced. To further complicate things, John Carter's 
        manuscript used hieroglyphics to represent Barsoomian words; Edgar Rice 
        Burroughs, who prepared John Carter's manuscripts for publication, then 
        spelled these words as he heard John Carter pronounce them. For instance, 
        in a footnote discussed the use of the word <i>radium</i> in <i>A Princess 
        Of Mars</i>, Burroughs writes, &quot;In Captain Carter's manuscript it 
        [radium] is mentioned always by the name used in the written language 
        of Helium and is spelled in hieroglyphics, which it would be difficult 
        and useless to reproduce.&quot;</p>
      <p>Burroughs transcribed all words as if they were English words; thus <i>zode</i>, 
        for instance, is probably pronounced with a silent 'e' (to rhyme with 
        <i>lode</i>), but we cannot be sure.</p>
      <p>Burroughs used the following vowel symbols: A, AI, E, EE, I, O, OO, U.</p>
      <p>He used the following consonant symbols and digraphs: B, C, D, DJ, DW, 
        F, G, K, L, LL, M, N, NG, PT, QU, R, S, SK, ST, SS, T, TH, TZ, V, X. Two 
        digraphs are used only in dialects - LL is used only in Okarian, while 
        SS is used only in the valley Dor.</p>
      <p>The exact sounds of all of these symbols are currently unknown. For instance, 
        without further field study, we cannot know whether 'th' was voiced or 
        unvoiced, whether 'dj' was pronounced [dy] or [dzh].</p>
      <p>The following consonant clusters may be treated as single consonants 
        in the morphology: DJ, DW, PT, QU, SK and ST. This is still being investigated.</p>
      <p>We do not know why John Carter chose to use the letter 'c' instead of 
        'k'; perhaps this was colored by the knowledge of one of the Barsoomian 
        writing systems. Barsoomian races had many different methods of writing, 
        ranging from pictographs to ideographs and perhaps even to consonantal 
        alphabets. More likely, this was simply an arbitrary decision of John 
        Carter's part. Our analysis of the vocabulary shows no instances where 
        Carter's use of 'c' or 'k' distinguishes two words (e.g., there is no 
        word <i>kalot </i>as distinct from <i>calot</i>). Therefore, we feel that 
        'c' and 'k' both represent the same underlying sound /k/. (The only words 
        using 'c' are <i>calot</i> and three proper nouns: Bar Comas, Carthoris 
        and Sarkoja.) </p>
      <h3><a name="Phonotactics"></a>Phonotactics</h3>
      <p>Phonotactics is the sequential arrangements of phonemes that are possible 
        in a language. The Barsoomian system of phonotactics is still under study. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <h2><a name="Grammar"></a>Grammar</h2>
      <p>Little is known about Barsoomian grammar, though it must have been a 
        comparatively simple grammar for John Carter to have been able to learn 
        it so quickly. The following are all hypotheses about the grammar: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Barsoomian lacks number distinctions, articles and noun declensions. 
        </li>
        <li>Barsoomian does not conjugate verbs or mark them for tense. For instance, 
          _sak_ is translated both as &quot;jump!&quot; (imperative) and &quot;to 
          jump&quot; (infinitive). </li>
        <li>Sentences follow the SVO order - Subject, Verb, Object. </li>
        <li>Questions have the same sentence form as statements, but end in a 
          question word, such as &quot;who&quot;, &quot;what&quot;, &quot;when&quot;, 
          &quot;why&quot;, or &quot;maybe&quot;. The sentence &quot;When will 
          we enjoy the death throes of the red one? or does Lorquas Ptomel, Jed, 
          intend holding her for ransom?&quot; would have a literal translation 
          of &quot;We has joy of death pains of red woman when? or Lorquas Ptomel, 
          Jed, put her up for ransom, maybe?&quot; </li>
        <li>The language has a second person pronoun contrast between formal and 
          familiar (translated by Carter as &quot;thee&quot; or &quot;thou&quot;). 
          It is assumed it had pronouns for first, second and third person. If 
          most words are unmarked for part of speech, the language may have had 
          no special forms for possessive pronouns.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2><a name="WordSets"></a>Word Sets</h2>
      <p>This section looks at word sets such as proper names, numbers and military 
        terms. </p>
      <h3>Proper Names</h3>
      <p>Naming practices differ significantly from culture to culture on Barsoom. 
        In many culture's, a father's name is often incorporated into the name 
        of his son, either as the first or second element: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mors Kajak, son of Tardos Mors (of Helium) </li>
        <li>Djor Kantos, son of Kantos Kan (of Helium) </li>
        <li>Sab Than, son of Than Khosis (of Zodanga) </li>
        <li>Hal Vas, son of Vas Kor (of Dusar) </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Among the green men, once a green Martian kills his first warrior, he 
        takes that warrior's second name as his own. John Carter, when he lived 
        among the green men, earned the name Dotar Sojat by slaying two warriors. 
      </p>
      <h3>Numerals</h3>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&quot;Another subject of interest is that of Barsoomian numbers. Little 
          information is available, our main source being those hormads created 
          by Ras Thavas, who were identified by number (in <i>Synthetic Men of 
          Mars</i>). This has helped in drawing up a table, but unfortunately 
          only five hormads are so designated: <i>Tor-dur-bar </i>= four million 
          eight (SMM/4), <i>Teeaytan-ov </i>= eleven hundred seven (SMM/4), <i>Ay-mad 
          </i>= one man (SMM/11), <i>Il-dur-en </i>= ? million ? (SMM/11), <i>Dur-dan 
          </i>= million ? (SMM/15). </p>
        <p>&quot;Even here we have three unknowns: <i>il</i>, <i>en </i>and <i>dan</i>. 
          Assuming they are primary numbers, they could be any of the primary 
          numbers two, three, five, six and nine.&quot; </p>

      <h3>Military Titles &amp; Units</h3>
      <p>The military titles are all attested, but most of the names of military 
        units are conjecture. But if we assume that *<i>u-</i> [&lt; <i>utan</i> 
        and <i>umak</i>] is a prefix meaning &quot;military unit&quot; joined 
        to a number word (<i>tan </i>and <i>mak </i>are both attested), we can 
        interpolate *<i>utee</i> and *<i>udur</i> (where <i>dur</i> is &quot;million&quot;, 
        used figuratively). The term <i>dar</i> is assumed to have the following 
        etymology: &lt; *<i>udar</i> &lt; *<i>u- </i>and <i>dar, </i>&quot;ten 
        thousand&quot;. The <i>*ujed</i> and <i>*ujeddak</i> terms are pure conjecture.</p>

      <h2><a name="Lexicon"></a>Lexicon</h2>
      <p>The following lexicon has been adapted from the glossary at the end of 
        <i>Thuvia, Maid Of Mars</i>. We are working on adding additional entries, 
        and will also be providing the etymologies of words, where we can determine 
        them. Unfortunately for those trying to translate texts, most of the lexicon 
        consists of proper nouns.</p>
      <p>The lexicon lists the Barsoomian term, an educated guess of its division 
        into syllables, its meaning, and the book it was first mentioned in, using 
        the following abbreviations: </p>
      <ol>
        <li><i>A Princess Of Mars</i> (APOM) </li>
        <li><i>The Gods Of Mars</i> (TGOM) </li>
        <li><i>The Warlord Of Mars</i> (TWOM) </li>
        <li><i>Thuvia, Maid Of Mars</i> (TMOM) </li>
      </ol>
      <p>The lexicon is currently only up to the first four books of the series 
        and will be expanded. </p>

        <dt>Aisle of Hope</dt>
        <dd>An aisle leading to the court-room in Helium. - TMOMg </dd>
        <dt>apt - APT</dt>
        <dd>An Arctic monster. A huge, white-furred creature with six limbs, four 
          of which, short and heavy, carry it over the snow and ice; the other 
          two, which grow forward from its shoulders on either side of its long, 
          powerful neck, terminate in white, hairless hands with which it seizes 
          and holds its prey. Its head and mouth are similar in appearance to 
          those of a hippopotamus, except that from the sides of the lower jawbone 
          two mighty horns curve slightly downward toward the front. Its two huge 
          eyes extend in two vast oval patches from the center of the top of the 
          cranium down either side of the head to below the roots of the horns, 
          so that these weapons really grow out from the lower part of the eyes, 
          which are composed of several thousand ocelli each. Each ocellus is 
          furnished with its own lid, and the apt can, at will, close as many 
          of the facets of his huge eyes as he chooses. - TMOM </dd>

        <dd>Barsoomian lion. A fierce beast of prey that roams the low hills surrounding 
          the dead seas of ancient Mars. It is almost hairless, having only a 
          great, bristly mane about its thick neck. Its long, lithe body is supported 
          by ten powerful legs, its enormous jaws are equipped with several rows 
          of long needle-like fangs, and its mouth reaches to a point far back 
          of its tiny ears. It has enormous protruding eyes of green. - TGOM </dd>

          in length. Each hair is about the thickness of a large angleworm. The 
          body, legs and feet are of human shape but of monstrous proportions, 
          the feet being fully three feet long and very flat and broad. The method 
          of feeding consists in running their odd hands over the surface of the 
          turf, cropping off the tender vegetation with razor-like talons and 
          sucking it up from two mouths, which lie one in the palm of each hand. 
          They are equipped with a massive tail about six feet long, quite round 
          where it joins the body, but tapering to a flat, thin blade toward the 
          end, which trails at right angles to the ground. - TMOMg </dd>
