          <h2><a name="4">Emulating Tolkien</a></h2>
          When learning a craft, whether writing, sculpting or creating model 
          languages, it always helps to begin by purposefully copying a master's 
          style. This enables you to begin creating and gives you time to experiment 
          prior to developing your own style. For instance, my first poetry slavishly 
          followed e.e. cummings. My first attempt at a children's book faithfully 
          echoed the voice of Dr. Seuss. Interestingly, my first attempt at a 
          model language did not emulate Tolkien, but copied Clyde Heaton's <a href="/db/mdl_orcish.htm">Orcish</a>, 
          a language he published in an article called &quot;Even Orcish is logical&quot; 
          (<em>Dragon</em> magazine, July 1983), which started me on this hobby. 
          <p> One of the language families I have tinkered with the longest is 
            meant to be spoken by elves, like Tolkien's Quenya and Sindarin; my 
            Alvish and Old Alvish languages date back some 13 years now. My first 
            attempt at Alvish was patterned closely on Anglo-Saxon, and the language 
            existed as little more than a source language for Karkrak, then the 
            principal language I was working on. About five years ago, I revamped 
            Alvish to resemble ancient Greek, which I first thought gave the language 
            a noble sound. When that did not meet my fancy, I revamped the language 
            again and developed a 3000-word vocabulary for it. Some sample vocabulary, 
            from Alvish III:

          I have no idea what I was aiming for, but the result is undeniably ugly. 
          Ipipneb? Frithfrith? 
          <p> Recently, I have decided to try and pattern Alvish more closely 
            on Quenya and Sindarin, inspired in part by a recent discussion on 
            the CONLANG mailing list, where David Bell discussed his language 
            Amman-lar, originally a Tolkien clone, before Bell found his own voice 
            (you can subscribe to CONLANG by sending an e-mail with the subject 
            text SUBSCRIBE CONLANG &lt;YOUR NAME&gt; to majordomo@diku.dk). 
          <p> Before creating Alvish IV, I closely studied the Quenya and Sindarin 
            words published in <em>The Silmarillion</em>. I decided that what 
            sounded pleasing to me was the emphasis on sounds produced towards 
            the front of the mouth (e.g., /p/, /b/, /f/, /v/, /i/, /e/, /a/). 
            Additionally, syllables in Sindarin and Quenya typically followed 
            the style CV or CVN, where N was a nasal (/m/ or /n/), lateral (/l/) 
            or approximant (/r/). Based on this insight, I then produced the following 
            definition of the phonotactics (sound and syllable structure) for 
            Old Alvish, the ancestor of Alvish: 
          <blockquote> (Con1) Vwl (Con2) </blockquote>
          where 
          <blockquote> Con1 = p, b, f, v, t, d, c, g, y, w, ch, gh<br>
            Vwl = i, a, o, u, uu<br>
            Con2 = m, l, n, r, s </blockquote>
          The /c/ is pronounced as in <em>cat</em>, /ch/ as in <em>loch</em>, 
          /gh/ is a voiced /ch/ (as /g/ is a voiced /c/). Each of the above lists 
          of phonemes is roughly arranged with those sounds pronounced closest 
          to the front of the mouth listed first. Sounds are listed in declining 
          order of occurrence in actual Old Alvish words. 
          <p> A further restriction to possible combinations of phonemes is that 
            whenever there are two adjacent vowels (e.g., the /i/ and /o/ are 
            in separate syllables in <em>dios</em>, /di-os/) they can only be 
            one of the following: i-o, i-uu, i-a, u-o, u-i, u-a, o-i. So, for 
            example, <em>diis</em> is not a valid Old Alvish word, since /i-i/ 
            is not a valid combination. (The dash - is used to indicate syllable 
            breaks.) 
          <p> Some sample Old Alvish words and phrases:
          <blockquote> anim<br>
            basuus<br>
            buci<br>
            chi gicuu<br>
            dafon<br>
            ghis<br>
            gibas<br>
            ogus dian<br>
            toman<br>
            vafus </blockquote>
          The sound system for Old Alvish is less flexible than that of Tolkien's 
          languages. Words like <em>Aglarond</em>, <em>Amarth</em>, <em>Bragollach</em> 
          and <em>Minas Tirith</em> could not be formed in Old Alvish, due its 
          different syllable structure, but would be probably be borrowed in forms 
          like <em>Agelaronde</em>, <em>Amarte</em>, <em>Beragolcha</em> and <em>Minas 
          Tirti</em>. 
          <p> But Old Alvish's sole purpose in my design is to provide a source 
            for Alvish. I designed Old Alvish to have an elegant structure, which 
            has become more complicated (and therefore more flexible) in Alvish. 
          <p> I decided that Alvish developed from Old Alvish according to the 
            following steps. First, Middle Alvish was distinguished from Old Alvish 
            by the following sound shifts, designed to give the language even 
            more front sounds: 
          <blockquote> /c/ > /th/<br>
            /g/ > /h/<br>
            /ch/ > /c/<br>
            /gh/ > /g/ 
            <p> /a/ > /e/<br>
              /uu/ > /o/<br>
              /o/ > /a/ 
          </blockquote>
          This had the net effect of giving Middle Alvish three sounds that it 
          did not have before (/th/, /h/ and /e/) while eliminating three sounds 
          that it had had (/ch/, /gh/ and /uu/). 
          <p> Some examples: 
          <blockquote> MA buthi &lt; OA buci<br>
            MA ci hitho &lt; OA chi gicuu<br>
            MA defan &lt; OA dafon<br>
            MA gis &lt; OA ghis </blockquote>
          As this example should illustrate, you can quickly generate your own 
          languages, based on a source language, simply by preparing tables of 
          sound correspondences such as the one above. (Refer to the &quot;Sounds&quot; 
          section of <a href="ml0102.htm#1d">MODLANG 2</a> for more information 
          on this.) A phoneme can gradually become pronounced as any &quot;neighboring&quot; 
          sound, where a &quot;neighborhood&quot; consists of similar physical 
          positions of articulation. By this measure, the shift of /c/ to /th/ 
          is unlikely, as the physical positions of the two sounds are far apart, 
          but this can be explained away by positing an intermediate step; e.g., 
          the sound /c/ came to be pronounced as /t/ (as in OA <em>buci</em> becoming 
          Early Middle Alvish <em>buti</em>), before the /t/ phonemes so produced 
          came to be pronounced as /th/ (MA <em>buthi</em>). 
          <p> The next series of sound shifts distinguishes Middle Alvish from 
            Alvish and is more complex. In this series, there are no straightforward 
            one- to-one correspondences, where one occurrence of a phoneme always 
            becomes another phoneme. In the transition to Alvish, sounds changed 
            only because of their environment (the other sounds they are pronounced 
            near). While the notation used to describe these can grow quite complex, 
            inventing sound changes like the following is not difficult. Basically, 
            I spent a lot of time trying to make sure that Alvish words fit my 
            preconceptions of what words I found aesthetically pleasing, and I 
            then formulated rules to give me a way to get from the strict phonotactics 
            of Old Alvish to something looser. 
          <p> The main changes from Alvish to Old Alvish are in the phonotactics. 
            An Alvish word can begin or end with any consonant, but the consonants 
            in the middle must follow similar patterns to Old Alvish. 
          <blockquote> FIRST SYLLABLE 
            <blockquote> (ConWI) Vwl (ConSF) </blockquote>
            INTERNAL SYLLABLES 
            <blockquote> (ConSI) Vwl (ConSF) </blockquote>
            TERMINAL SYLLABLE 
            <blockquote> (ConSI) Vwl (ConWF) </blockquote>
            <p> ONE-SYLLABLE WORD 
            <blockquote> (ConWI) Vwl (ConWF) </blockquote>
          </blockquote>
          where 
          <blockquote> ConWI = p, b, f, v, t, d, c, g, y, w, th, h, m, l, n, r, 
            s, sp, st, sc<br>
            ConSI = p, b, f, v, t, d, c, g, y, w, th, h, s, sp, st, sc<br>
            Vwl = i, e, a, u, o<br>
            ConSF = m, l, n, r<br>
            ConWF = p, b, f, v, t, d, c, g, y, w, th, h, m, l, n, r, s </blockquote>
          Clearly, this sort of mapping out of all sound combinations can grow 
          much more complex than you want or need for a model language, but the 
          complexity of Alvish phonotactics pales in comparison to the phonotactics 
          of English, which would take a small book to describe in detail (e.g., 
          the only time an English word can begin with three consonant sounds 
          the first consonant has to be /s/, as in <em>spring</em>, not something 
          like <em>zbring</em>). 
          <p> The rules for deriving Alvish words from Middle Alvish are: 
          <blockquote> /ti/ &gt; /thi/<br>
            /a-i/ &gt; /i-a/ (eliminating the only vowel pair to begin with /a/; 
            e.g., /thi-al-fu/ < MA /tha-il-fu/)<br>
            /s-/ &gt; /-s/ (removing /s/ from being a possible final consonant 
            for internal syllables; e.g., /i-san/ &gt; MA /is-an/)<br>
            /-sX/ &gt; /-X/ where X&lt;&gt;/a/,/e/,/i/,/o/,/u/,/p/,/t/,/c/ (any 
            /s/ that migrated before an X is omitted; e.g., /pa-fu/ < MA /pas-fu/)<br>
            /-DVC#/ &gt; /D#/ where D=/t/,/d/; V is a vowel, C is consonant and 
            # indicates the end of a word (this rule indicates that final syllables 
            that begin with /t/ or /d/ move the dental phoneme to the end of the 
            previous syllable and truncate the remaining syllable; e.g., /alt/ 
            &gt; MA /al-ten/)<br>
            /mD#/ &gt; /nD#/ (any final /md/ or /mt/ formed by the previous rule 
            replaces /m/ with /n/)<br>
            /#V1T-V2/ &gt; /#TV2/ where T=/m/,/n/,/l/,/r/,/s/ (any word that begins 
            with a vowel and is followed by a syllable-terminating consonant and 
            a following vowel -- starting a new syllable -- drops the initial 
            vowel and moves the consonant to the next syllable; e.g., /nim/ &gt; 
            MA /en- im/). </blockquote>
          One thing I've ignored when doing sounds shifts is whether a phoneme 
          was in a stressed or unstressed syllable. Contrast English /ob-JECT/ 
          (&quot;I object, your honor&quot;) to /OB-ject/ (&quot;the object of 
          the game is this&quot;). In English, the vowel /o/ has become a schwa 
          in the unstressed syllable in /ob-JECT/ but not in the stressed syllable 
          in /OB-ject/. Rather than deal with the issue of stress (which in the 
          Alvish languages always falls on the penultimate -- next-to-last -- 
          syllable), I decided that elves are more fastidious in their pronunciation 
          and blur sounds less in unstressed syllables than mere mortals do... 
          It's a cop out, but this is supposed to be fun, right? 
          <p> I won't formally describe the rules for forming compound words in 
            Alvish. But forming compounds does have a number of twists, mainly 
            designed to make sure that the resulting word matches the phonotactics 
            of Alvish defined above. The rules:
          <ul>
            <li> For the first of the two words compounded, anytime a vowel immediately 
              follows another vowel (e.g., /e/ in /i-e/), that vowel is dropped. 
            <li> When the first word ends in a vowel and the second word begins 
              with a vowel, those vowels change into an acceptable vowel pair 
              (if they're not already); e.g., i-a, i-o, i-e, u-a, u-i, u-e. 
            <li> When the first word ends in a consonant, that consonant can be 
              only /m/, /n/, /l/ or /r/, otherwise it moves to the front of the 
              second word (if the second word begins with a vowel) or it is deleted. 
            <li> This process is inverted when the second word *begins* with a 
              consonant; since that consonant cannot be /m/, /n/, /l/ or /r/, 
              the consonant moves to the end of the first word, unless the first 
              word ends in a consonant, in which case it is dropped altogether. 
              Whew! 
          </ul>
          Based on all these rules, I derived some sample words for Alvish. These 
          words have no assigned meanings, since I have just been experimenting 
          to make sure that I like the resulting sounds of the words generated.
