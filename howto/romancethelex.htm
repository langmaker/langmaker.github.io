      <h2>Roll Your Own Romance Lexicon</h2>
      <p><i><a href="mailto:kula@totalnetnh.net">Duncan Duchov</a> has kindly 
        taken a Latin lexical file I compiled from several sources and prepared 
        it for use with LangMaker/Win. He welcomes comments and corrections.</i></p>
      <p><i>Introduction, </i><i><a href="../langmake/latin.lex">Latin LEX File</a>, 
        <a href="../wordlist/latin.htm">Latin HTML File</a></i></p>
      <p>Dear Mr. Henning: </p>
      <p>Please let me explain basically what I did to the dictionary that you 
        sent to me. I changed the verbs to their infinitive forms and changed 
        the nouns and adverbs into their nominative masculine forms; I hope to 
        explain why shortly. </p>
      <p>There were some errors in the text that you mailed me, and I hope that 
        I caught them all; they were generally small. There were also a few odd 
        translations, so I tried to polish them up a bit; some may have been technically 
        correct but made me laugh aloud (the one that sticks in my mind is 'swimming 
        pool' for <i>piscina</i>), so I changed them too. </p>
      <p>As a side note, I tried to change the British English forms into American 
        English forms, for there was a mixing in the text (probably an American 
        drawing from a British source). </p>
      <p>The words that ended up in the final file were chosen in a rather arbitrary 
        manner, by me and of course by the individual who first compiled the dictionary. 
        Some of his/her words I omitted, for various reasons, and I added quite 
        a number of my own. Hopefully the selection would be enough for a common 
        Roman citizen to make it through the day without resorting to circumlocution 
        too frequently, but I am sure that I've missed something here and there. 
      </p>
      <p>I intended for the vocabulary to reflect what would be used sometime 
        after Augustus died, having drawn some foreign words from non-Latin sources, 
        but before the language had assimilated too much alien matter or started 
        to become vulgar. Not that I believe that it should be 'pure', but I feel 
        that an earlier form might be the most useful of all the possible choices, 
        and give users options. These details can be noted in such words as <i>Julius</i> 
        for 'July' and <i>Augustus</i> for 'August' (instead of the older names 
        for the months), and the adoption from the Celts of the word <i>sapo</i> 
        but not yet <i>caballus</i>. Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. I think 
        that you get the point. </p>
      <p>If anyone feels that they need to add, delete, or change vocabulary because 
        they require a different source material, tell 'em to go nuts. One of 
        the largest problems I had in compiling the file was trying to find a 
        middle ground in what I imagined it would be used for. I presume that 
        a good portion of the downloads will be used to create one of two things: 
        languages for a Dark/Middle Ages RPG setting - which would need words 
        for items such as swords and torches - and languages for a modern-day 
        or futuristic alternative reality where Romans had conquered the world 
        or at least held a large portion of it. In the latter case, the language 
        maker might need vocabulary such as 'automobile' but have no true need 
        for 'torch.' Therefore I tried to make it pretty non-specific, but there 
        is a slant toward RPG-possible words in there, and no truly 'modern' ones. 
        Again, let people add what they need; I'm just trying to hit a common 
        denominator. </p>
      <p>As I have informed you, I included the infinitives of the verbs and the 
        masculine nominative forms of the nouns. This may be a vocabulary skeleton 
        crew, and almost goes against the very feeling of Latin, but I feel that 
        adding anything more might result in confusion rather than clarification. 
        The prime reason for my decision is that, as you know, the Romance languages 
        have changed in grammar proportionally more than they have in vocabulary. 
        It seems to have been a trend, for example, for the Latin-based languages 
        to lose the nominative plural and assume in its place a version of the 
        accusative case. So if I were to have typed in all of the nominative plural 
        endings, they would probably end up being changed anyway. Even worse, 
        a language maker might feel that he should keep all the cases and conjugations. 
        Cute, but Latin-based languages didn't work like that. Instead, they grew 
        from the infinitives and the nominative case. There is no doubt in my 
        mind that anyone who intends to design his own truly Romance tongue will 
        need not only a book of Latin grammar, but also books of French, Spanish, 
        Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian. Only then will be able to get an idea 
        of how the language changed over the millennia into the versions we now 
        know. </p>
      <p>What would Romanian be without <i>brinza</i>, adopted from the Dacians? 
        Would a Frenchman seem right if he said anything other than <i>tete</i>? 
        It seems obvious that the most difficult part of a new Romance language 
        would be the grammar. What cases were lost? Were new ones formed? What 
        foreign terms were adopted? After that deciding all of that, the vocab 
        becomes easy... or relatively so... </p>
      <p>Obviously, there are errors in this file. I am not a native Latin speaker, 
        I often worked from my head, and I am by no means a professional. But 
        I do think that the dictionary is generally O.K. - there shouldn't be 
        any horrible, glaring errors. Feel free to check it over yourself, and 
        edit it as you feel fit. And if anyone notices any errors, please have 
        them get back to <a href="mailto:kula@totalnetnh.net">me</a> - I'm as 
        eager to learn about them as the pickiest nit picker that ever picked 
        nits is. When it comes to things like this, I feel that perfection is 
        a must. </p>
      <p>And as a last note, I realize that there are no indicators for stress 
        or vowel length. I tried to keep it simple, to avoid unnecessary complexity 
        and errors. I hope that you agree with my judgment... </p>

      <p>Dear Mr. Henning:</p>
      <p>As I have said before, I am no expert on the Romance languages. I haven't<br>
        visited the forum, so I'm not sure about the comment exactly, but the 
        point made<br>
        might very well be true. Likewise, it might be untrue - without sources, 
        nobody<br>
        can tell. Needless to say, this is a detail that could impact virtually 
        all of<br>
        the Latin-based conlangs created.</p>
      <p>I am reasonably certain that the plural forms of Romance nouns were often 
        or<br>
        always taken from the Latin accusative case. I have attached a few sources 
        that<br>
        have led me to believe this to this letter; feel free to make of them 
        what you<br>
        will. I had not heard before the idea that the singular forms of the nouns 
        were<br>
        also taken from the Latin accusative, and don't have any material that<br>
        contradicts that claim. The only reason that I had never assumed such 
        a thing<br>
        is by looking at words the descendants of Latin, which often seem to be<br>
        near-direct duplicates of their distant ancestors: take the Spanish 'casa,' 
        for<br>
        example, from the Latin 'casa.' On the other hand this means nothing: 
        the<br>
        accusative form of the Latin 'casa,' for example, is 'casam' - and many 
        scholars<br>
        dedicated to restoring Classical Latin pronunciation (e.g. Stephen Daitz) 
        seem<br>
        to feel that the final 'm' in Latin was pronounced as a nasal, not as 
        an m<br>
        proper. Therefore 'casam' would have been pronounced as 'cas' followed 
        a<br>
        nasalized 'a,' and its only a short phonetic step to reach 'casa' again. 
        And<br>
        take 'liber,' which became the French 'livre'; it certainly sounds as 
        though it<br>
        could have come from 'librum.' I am inclined to believe the post is factual 
        to<br>
        some degree, perhaps completely.</p>
      <p>The most important question is this: how does this effect us here and 
        now with<br>
        regards to this .lex file? Well, unless you try to fool around with the 
        final<br>
        'm' in the 1st-Declension Feminine nouns that end in 'a,' they should 
        be O.K.<br>
        'Terra' will yield 'terra' again. Unfortunately the other nouns will not 
        fare<br>
        nearly as well: 'ager' becomes 'agrum,' and a heap of confusion forms. 
        Some<br>
        might be all right, depending on how you transform them: 'amicus,' accusative<br>
        'amicum,' will be fine if you drop the final letter in both cases (the 
        worst pun<br>
        ever.) Hence the Spanish 'amigo.'</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, I don't have the time right now to decline all of the 
        nouns in<br>
        the dictionary. I wish that I did. If you know anyone who would like to 
        take<br>
        the initiative to do so, tell them to feel free - they might be helping 
        a lot of<br>
        people.</p>
      <p>And please: if you know anyone that has any sources that could help to 
        clear up<br>
        this matter - historical grammars or whatnot - please have these people 
        refer us<br>
        to them , or better yet have them type away and you can post them. This 
        is a<br>
        community, and manus manum lavat. (Odd example in that last sentence: 
        Spanish<br>
        uses 'manos' for hand, right? Hunh? Now I'm confused.)</p>
      <p>I wish I could be more helpful here; unfortunately, I'm not much of a 
        Romance<br>
        scholar. I haven't even used the Latin .lex, and probably won't for awhile.<br>
        (To be honest, I'm more interested in Celtic and Slavic languages.) Sorry!<br>
        Please keep me informed!</p>

      <p><br>
        Is English a creole?</p>
      <p>The change from Anglo-Saxon to Modern English (loss of gender and of 
        case<br>
        inflection, phonological change, acquisition of a huge stock of French 
        and<br>
        Latin vocabulary) is certainly dramatic, and has led some sci.lang posters,<br>
        and even some linguists (e.g. Domingue, Bailey &amp; Maroldt, Milroy) 
        to the<br>
        provocative postulation that English suffered pidginization or creolization<br>
        at the time of the Norman Conquest (1066) or at the time of the Norse<br>
        invasions (from 865), or both.</p>
      <p>This hypothesis, as Sarah Grey Thomason and Terence Kaufman have shown 
        in<br>
        Language Contact, Creolization, and Genetic Linguistics (1988), rests 
        on an<br>
        incomplete understanding of creolization and a shaky grasp on the history<br>
        of English. There is a wide range of language contact situations, from<br>
        casual contact to deep structural interference; English is by no means 
        the<br>
        most striking of these cases. It looks like a creole only if one ignores<br>
        this range of phenomena and calls any case of moderate structural<br>
        interference a case of creolization.</p>
      <p>For many of the changes in question, the chronology does not work out. 
        For<br>
        instance, the reduction of unstressed vowels to /@/, largely responsible<br>
        for the loss of Old English nominal declensions, had taken place before 
        the<br>
        Conquest, and affected all of England, including areas never settled by 
        the<br>
        Norse. And English did absorb an immense amount of French and Latin<br>
        vocabulary, but most of this occurred well after the Conquest-- past 1450,<br>
        two centuries after the nobility ceased to be French-speaking.</p>
      <p>Other points to note: 1) most of the simplifications and foreign borrowings<br>
        seen in English occurred as well in other Germanic languages, notably<br>
        Dutch, Low German, and the Scandinavian languages; 2) a particularly<br>
        striking borrowing from Norse, the pronoun 'they', was probably adopted 
        to<br>
        avoid what otherwise would have been a merger of 'he/him' with 'they/them';<br>
        3) the total number of French-speaking invaders was not more than 50,000,<br>
        compared to an English-speaking population of over 1.5m-- nowhere near 
        the<br>
        proportions that would threaten the normal inheritance of English.</p>

      <p>Message 4: plural data</p>
      <p>Date: Wed, 09 Oct 91 21:08:53 EDT<br>
        From: &lt;JAREA@UKCC.uky.edu&gt;<br>
        Subject: plural data</p>
      <p>Many people who may have less Latin that Jonson attributed to Shaxper<br>
        continue to be overheated about the use of 'data' as a singular. In<br>
        Latin this form was the neuter plural (nominative and accusative) while<br>
        'datum' was the nominative and accusative singular. These people feel<br>
        that to 'misuse' a plural like 'data' as a singular, taking singular<br>
        demonstratives and verbs, does violence to Latin, and thus to English.<br>
        If these people knew more about Latin, they would realize that already<br>
        in Classical Latin such second declension neuter plurals were often<br>
        used as singulars syntactically, sometimes with collective force as is<br>
        clearly the situation with 'data'. Further, the Romance languages have<br>
        carried this further, so that it is not at all unusual for one Romance<br>
        language to take the singular of these former neuters as a singular, and<br>
        make a new (masculine) plural, and for another RL to take the neuter plural<br>
        as a singular, creating a new (feminine) plural. There are also traces 
        of<br>
        this in other Indo-European languages, leading one to suspect that the 
        same<br>
        situation held in part for PIE (whatever that was). For Latin, a handy<br>
        reference might be Ernout, _Morphologie historique du latin_ #2A, or for<br>
        Romance treatments Rohlfs _Grammatica storica della lingua italiana...:<br>
        v.2 Morfologia #384. Let us not stand in the way of an historical process<br>
        that has been under way for millenia (My god, there's another one of those<br>
        wretched neuter plurals!)</p>

        know where to find some folks who CAN answer.!&quot; So, folks, here it 
        is:<br>
        &quot;How did it come about that Western European languages such as<br>
        English, French, Spanish and Portuguese have chosen to make most<br>
        plural words by adding an 's' or 'es' to the singular? Italian, Greek,<br>
        German, and, I believe, the Slavic languages do not do this. Latin did 
        not<br>
        either.&quot;</p>
      <p>Herewith, a compilation of responses to this question.<br>
        ++++++++</p>
      <p>With respect to the Romance languages, the answers generally went like<br>
        this:</p>
      <p>A partial answer wrt Romance. First of all, the &quot;Latin did not either&quot; 
        bit<br>
        is incorrect. Most accusative plurals ended in -AS, -OS, or -ES - and<br>
        that's where the Western Romance languages got their plural -s from. In<br>
        Italian, it seems the nominative plural endings (-AE, -I, -ES) were<br>
        generalised and passed on to the accusatives.The class of plurals in -ES<br>
        was eventually redistributed over the two others, which gives you the<br>
        modern Italian situation of plurals in -e and in -i. All Romance<br>
        languages, as far as I know, continued the accusative forms only, except<br>
        in some marginal cases.<br>
        ++++++++<br>
        The Slavic answer was pretty straightforward:</p>
      <p>They do not occur in Slavic at all. Proto Slavic went through a period<br>
        when all syllables become open, hence word final (syllable final) s was<br>
        lost.<br>
        You might try the Baltic languages which didn't go through that.<br>
        Everything seems to end in 's' in Latvian.<br>
        ++++++++</p>
      <p>With respect to English, answers of the following sort were typical:</p>
      <p>Actually the Latin accusative plurals and dative and ablative plurals<br>
        in all genders ended in -s. In early English, when it was still an<br>
        inflected language using many of the Latin endings, the vowel endings<br>
        dropped as time went on. This meant that the only distinguishing<br>
        feature separating plural from singular nouns was the -s termination.<br>
        So, English did get it from Latin (Greek had -s plurals too).<br>
        ++++++++</p>
      <p>A fairly complete answer went like this:</p>
      <p>Just saw your query on Linguist. The answer is historical accident,<br>
        in that Proto-Indo-European had a number of plural types in -s, which<br>
        have survived in various shapes in different groups within the larger<br>
        family. E.g. Old English had a set of plurals in -as, which are the<br>
        source of our modern -s plurals, and this -s- element also appears<br>
        in Latin in some declensions. A contributing factor to the<br>
        preservation of these is that many other plural types were marked by<br>
        vowels or nasals, and these tended to drop in some languages. But<br>
        many languages in the groups don't use the -s plurals: e.g. Italian<br>
        has retained vowel plurals (-o sg vs. -i pl for masculines, -a sg vs.<br>
        -e pl for feminines), and Icelandic and Swedish don't use the -s<br>
        either, but later developments in -r, among other things. The secret<br>
        is which of the ancestral plural types happened to get generalized.<br>
        (E.g. also German doesn't use -s much except in special vocabulary,<br>
        while Dutch does more, and Afrikaans still more, to take another<br>
        subfamily). Hope this is of some use.<br>
        ++++++++</p>
      <p>Some were as intrigued as my colleague was:</p>
      <p>Romance -s stems from Vulgar Latin, not Classical Latin, and is<br>
        generally (I think) held to derive from Classical Latin accusative forms 
        in<br>
        -es, -as, -os etc. English -s is a loan from French, the Germanic plural<br>
        in English being seen today only in the marginal cases like feet and oxen<br>
        (ah, but WHY???).<br>
        Note the increase in -s plurals in Dutch (phonologically determined) and<br>
        German (morphologically and phonologically determined: die<br>
        Autos, die UFOs), the first (I presume) French influence, the second<br>
        possibly English influence.<br>
        ++++++++</p>
      <p>And my final correspondent even put in a nice cite:</p>
      <p>Middle English (1100-1500) -s or -es comes from the strong declension,<br>
        -en from the weak. Old English had some plurals in -as, which became<br>
        -es in Middle English.</p>
      <p>The -(e)s plural spread rapidly in the North of England, becoming the<br>
        norm in the Midlands by 1200. In 14th c., it became the norm all over<br>
        England.</p>

        LINGUIST List 6.1436</p>
      <p> Mon Oct 16 1995</p>
      <p>...</p>
      <p> Well I can't speak to the situation of the sciences or humanities<br>
        in general, but its hard to see any signs of the process in our own field.<br>
        It's true that there are a lot of nonlinguist participants in the<br>
        discussions on the Linguist List, some of them from neighboring<br>
        disciplines, some of them just kibitzers who have wandered in off the<br>
        street. But with occasional exceptions, these participants haven't had 
        much<br>
        effect in shifting the discursive center of gravity. On the contrary, 
        net<br>
        discussions seem to rely on those &quot;specialized commonplaces of disciplinary<br>
        discourse&quot; even more than other kinds of disciplinary colloquy do, 
        if only<br>
        because the medium tends to obscure or eliminate the institutional roles<br>
        and safeguards that ordinarily invest a written communication with<br>
        authority. There was a telling example on the Linguist List a few months<br>
        ago, when a philosopher wrote in a query on behalf of a friend:</p>
      <p> A colleague who makes his living as a translator of technical dox asked 
        me<br>
        something yesterday that I couldn't answer. &quot;But&quot;, I told him, 
        &quot;I bet I<br>
        know where to find some folks who CAN answer.!&quot; So, folks, here it 
        is:<br>
        &quot;How did it come about that Western European languages such as English,<br>
        French, Spanish and Portuguese have chosen to make most plural words by<br>
        adding an 's' or 'es' to the singular? Italian, Greek, German, and, I<br>
        believe, the Slavic languages do not do this. Latin did not either.&quot;</p>
      <p>A month or so later, the questioner posted a summary<br>
        of answers, which included all of the following:</p>
      <p> English -s is a loan from French, the Germanic plural in English being 
        seen<br>
        today only in the marginal cases like feet and oxen....</p>
      <p> Actually the Latin accusative plurals and dative and ablative plurals 
        in<br>
        all genders ended in -s. In early English, when it was still an inflected<br>
        language using many of the Latin endings, the vowel endings dropped as 
        time<br>
        went on. This meant that the only distinguishing feature separating plural<br>
        from singular nouns was the -s termination. So, English did get it from<br>
        Latin...</p>
      <p> The answer is historical accident, in that Proto-Indo-European had a 
        number<br>
        of plural types in -s, which have survived in various shapes in different<br>
        groups within the larger family. E.g. Old English had a set of plurals 
        in<br>
        -as, which are the source of our modern -s plurals, and this -s- element<br>
        also appears in Latin in some declensions...7</p>
      <p>Sit penem lectorem fides. The writer had indeed found some folks who 
        could<br>
        answer his colleague's question, the problem being that he apparently 
        had<br>
        no way of telling them from the linguistic wannabes who happened to be<br>
        sitting in on the discussion. You think of an American who shows up at 
        a<br>
        party in Paris speaking high-school French, unable to discern the accents<br>
        that mark off half the other guests as Americans, as well.</p>

        Popular Latin language</p>
      <p>Latin was spoken too widely in Europe, Africa and Asia. It was carried 
        there<br>
        constantly by Italian colonists who brought their tongue with them and<br>
        assimilated gradually aboriginal nations. That is how linguistic mixtures<br>
        appear. But it is not the way Popular Latin appeared first. Classical 
        Latin<br>
        began to suffer changes in colloquial language already in the last centuries<br>
        BC, when Rome finally managed to conquer all Italy. The Italics, who spoke<br>
        Umbrian, Oscan, Volscian etc., mixed slowly with Latin colonists.<br>
        This caused serious changes in the spoken language. The process of simplification 
        and analitization began at that time. Endings<br>
        of nouns and verbs began to be dropping everywhere, phonetics began<br>
        changing a little, and even the dictionary acquired more new words with<br>
        parallel loss of previously used. Some progressive features of Umbrian<br>
        became now a part of Latin.</p>
      <p>But the flourishing epoch of Popular Latin began when Roman colonists 
        faced<br>
        Celtic, Germanic, Thracian, Illyrian and Iberian lands and peoples. Here<br>
        mixing with so various nations turned Latin into varieties of dialects, 
        and<br>
        it's them that are called Popular Latin. It existed on vast territories 
        of<br>
        Europe since the 2nd century and till the 6th century AD, until it turned<br>
        into national Romance languages: Old French (Langue d'oil), Old Provencal<br>
        (langue d'oc), Spanish, Portuguese, Rumanian, Rumantsch etc. Nowadays<br>
        Romance languages are numerous, with numerous dialectal groups, but the<br>
        source was only one - Popular Latin.</p>
      <p>Great phonetic changes were one of the main features of Popular Latin. 
        New<br>
        sounds appeared (like [dj], [j], [sh], [ch], sibilants, aspirants, dentals<br>
        like [th], [ts]), diphthongs almost disemerged, final consonant dropped<br>
        practically everywhere.</p>
      <p>Such phonetic revolution led to grammar changes. Popular Latin carried 
        a<br>
        tendency to an uninflected language. From the six Latin noun cases, only 
        3<br>
        or 4 (in pronouns) remained here, and afterwards even 2 cases, for other<br>
        cases were expressed simply by prepositional nouns - the way it is done 
        now<br>
        in English and French. The definite (from demonstrative pronoun ille) 
        and<br>
        indefinite (from numeral unus) appeared, as well as the 3rd person personal<br>
        pronouns which Latin lacked. They also were formed from demonstrative<br>
        pronouns. The verb system, so terribly complicated in Latin, was altered,<br>
        and since then auxiliary verbs started expressing perfect, preterite,<br>
        plusquamperfect and future forms. The only thing that was preserved was 
        the<br>
        infect verbal endings.</p>
      <p>Popular Latin with all its varieties has much in common everywhere among<br>
        Romance languages, but the dialectal features depend on the region, on 
        the<br>
        nation which used to live here before Romans came and assimilated it.</p>
