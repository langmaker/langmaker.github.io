          <h2><a name="1">Growing up with language</a></h2>
          <blockquote><cite> The Shakespeare of model languages is J.R.R. Tolkien. 
            His best-selling fantasy novel, <em>The Lord Of The Rings</em>, now 
            considered a literary classic, achieved much of its believability 
            from the depth of its invented languages: Quenya, Sindarin, Adu^naic 
            and others. The following article provides a broad overview of Tolkien's 
            seminal work with model languages.</cite></blockquote>
          Tolkien was exposed to languages to a remarkable degree. He learned 
          Latin, German and French from his mother. At school, he learned or taught 
          himself Middle English, Old English, Finnish, Gothic, Greek, Italian, 
          Old Norse, Spanish, modern Welsh and medieval Welsh. He had an amazing 
          working knowledge of languages, and was familiar with Danish, Dutch, 
          Lombardic, Norwegian, Russian, Swedish and many ancestral Germanic and 
          Slavonic languages. It would have been no surprise to his mother that 
          he became a professional philologist. 
          <p> He even had a part-time job as a lexicographer for the original 
            Oxford English Dictionary -- the New English Dictionary, as it was 
            known then. He worked for the dictionary in 1919-1920 and learned 
            more about language than in any comparable period of his life. For 
            instance, he had to develop the etymologies of words like <em>water</em>, 
            <em>wick</em> and <em>winter</em>, and in so doing had to cite comparable 
            forms in other languages like proto-Teutonic, Old Teutonic, Old Saxon, 
            Middle Dutch, Modern Dutch, Old High German, Middle High German, Middle 
            Low German, Modern German, Old Slavonic, Lithuanian, Russian and Latin. 
            He did this commendably well; the head of the Dictionary, Dr. Henry 
            Bradley, said of Tolkien, &quot;His work gives evidence of an unusually 
            thorough mastery of Anglo-Saxon and of the facts and principles of 
            the comparative grammar of the Germanic languages. Indeed, I have 
            no hesitation in saying that I have never known a man of his age who 
            was in these respects his equal.&quot; 
          <p> These were the natural languages that Tolkien learnt, and they served 
            as an inspiration for his model languages. 
          <p> As a child, Tolkien was first exposed to model languages when he 
            learned a language his cousins had invented, called Animalic, which 
            primarily consisted of English animal names. For instance, <em>Dog 
            nightingale woodpecker forty</em> meant &quot;You are an ass.&quot; 
            Animalic served as an inspiration for Tolkien to create not just words, 
            but his own language. He and one of his cousins created a more involved 
            language than Animalic called Nevbosh (meaning New Nonsense) based 
            on disguised pieces of English, Latin and French. 
          <p> Nevbosh was his first attempt at creating an entire language. Already, 
            when learning Greek, he had made up pseudo-Greek words, but Nevbosh 
            went beyond that. Later, in his adolescence, Tolkien recalled Nevbosh 
            and resolved to invent a serious language, one richly developed to 
            model a natural language. 
          <p> It is not surprising that Tolkien as a teenager attempted such an 
            ambitious undertaking, given Tolkien's already established love of 
            language. As Tolkien's biographer, Humphrey Carpenter, writes, &quot;If 
            he had been interested in music, he very likely would have wanted 
            to compose melodies, so why should he not make up a personal system 
            of words that would be, as it were, a private symphony?&quot; Since 
            Tolkien's education had been intensively centered around language, 
            when he began to create, those creations took a linguistic form. 
          <p> Tolkien's first serious model language was called Naffarin. It was 
            strongly influenced by Spanish, but with its own phonology (sound 
            structure) and grammar. Tolkien chose Spanish because his guardian 
            (he had been orphaned at the age of twelve) was half-Spanish and had 
            lent him books on that language, which Tolkien found attractive. 
          <p> Naffarin was but the first of many model languages that Tolkien 
            would create. His next language began after he had purchased a Gothic 
            primer from a friend and become captivated by that language. Years 
            later, in a letter to W.H. Auden, Tolkien wrote, &quot;I discovered 
            in it [Gothic] not only modern historical philology, which appealed 
            to the historical and scientific side [of me], but for the first time 
            the study of a language out of mere love: I mean for the acute aesthetic 
            pleasure derived from a language for its own sake, not only free from 
            being useful but free even from being the vehicle of a literature.&quot; 
          <p> Since little of Gothic's vocabulary survives in its small corpus, 
            Tolkien soon found himself inventing words to fill in the gaps. This 
            in turn inspired him to create a hypothetical historical Germanic 
            language, one hitherto never discovered but with established relationships 
            to Old English, Gothic and other Germanic tongues. 
          <p> From Naffarin and Neo-Gothic, Tolkien went on to create a new model 
            language, inspired by Finnish. He had been studying for exams in the 
            Exeter College library at Oxford when he first encountered Finnish. 
            Years later, he compared the experience to tasting a fine wine: &quot;It 
            was like discovering a complete wine-cellar filled with bottles of 
            an amazing wine of a kind and flavour never tasted before. It quite 
            intoxicated me; and I gave up the attempt to invent an unrecorded 
            Germanic language, and my own language -- or series of invented languages 
            -- became heavily Finnicized in phonetic pattern and structure.&quot; 
            This was to become Quenya, his principal Elvish language, but elves 
            had not yet entered the picture. 
          <blockquote> 
            <h4>Chronological development of tolkien's principal model languages</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Nevbosh (inspired by English, French and Latin) 
              <li>Naffarin (inspired by Spanish) 
              <li>Neo-Gothic (filling holes in Gothic's vocabulary) 
              <li>&quot;Unrecorded Germanic&quot; (unnamed language related to 
                Old English, Gothic and other Germanic tongues) 
              <li>Quenya (inspired by Finnish, influenced by Latin and Greek) 
              <li>Primitive Eldarin 
              <li>Sindarin (inspired by Welsh) 
            </ul>
          </blockquote>
          Tolkien had devoted considerable efforts to fleshing out Quenya, when 
          he had begun to realize that he could not continue to create the language 
          without knowing something of the people who spoke it. He had written 
          poems in this language, but now he found himself needing to creating 
          a history for these people, whoever they might be. 
          <p> It so happened, at the age of 21, that he had an epiphany. He read 
            for the first time the Old English religious poem Crist of Cynewulf. 
            In it, he encountered two lines that were to fire his imagination 
            for years: <em>Eala Earendel engla beorhtast ofer middengeard monnum 
            sended</em>. &quot;Hail Earendel, brightest of angels, above middle 
            earth sent unto men.&quot; The words seemed to hint at something beautiful 
            and remote. While the Old English dictionary recorded Earendel as 
            a ray of light, Tolkien interpreted it literally as the star that 
            heralded the dawn's light (Venus) and figuratively as John the Baptist, 
            presaging Christ. In fact, Earendel heralded the light that would 
            be diffused into the Two Trees, the Silmarils and the vial of Galadrial: 
            all prominent works of light in his fiction. Tolkien wanted to discover 
            the truth behind these two Old English lines, and he began to conceive 
            of a greater story, involving a mariner. From this simple line about 
            Earendel, the line itself &quot;a leaf caught in the wind&quot;, Tolkien 
            began to discover the great tree of his mythology, which would pass 
            through many seasons, growing from &quot;The Lay of Earendel&quot; 
            to <em>The Book of Lost Tales</em> to <em>The Silmarillion</em>, <em>The 
            Hobbit</em> and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. 
          <p> As Tolkien wrote in his allegorical story &quot;Leaf By Niggle&quot;, 
            about a painter with a painting too detailed to ever finish: 
          <blockquote><cite> There was one picture in particular which bothered 
            him. It had begun with a leaf caught in the wind, and it became a 
            tree; and the tree grew, sending out innumerable branches, and thrusting 
            out the most fantastic roots. Strange birds came and settled on the 
            twigs and had to be attended to. Then all round the Tree, and behind 
            it, through the gaps in the leaves and boughs, a country began to 
            open out; and there were glimpses of a forest marching over the land, 
            and of mountains tipped with snow. </cite></blockquote>
          From that first leaf caught in the wind, that first glimpse of Earendel, 
          Tolkien then discovered elves, who were very different from the fairy 
          folk he had once composed poems about. Elves possessed grandeur and 
          dignity, being in fact -- in Tolkien's mind -- Un-Fallen Man. He realized 
          that the language he had created was in fact spoken by these elves. 
          As a result, he began to spend more time composing the stories of this 
          imaginary world, &quot;middle earth&quot; (which was a common name for 
          the world in Old English times, setting earth between heaven and hell). 
          Still, the languages and name-making occupied as much of his time as 
          the actual writing, since the writing of the history was for Tolkien 
          but a subset of the act of language creation (or subcreation, to use 
          his word for it, as he explicitly defined himself in relation to the 
          Creator). 
          <p> By 1917, Tolkien had expanded Quenya to many hundreds of words and 
            had even outlined its ancestral tongue, Primitive Eldarin. Primitive 
            Eldarin then gave rise to another prominent elvish language, Sindarin, 
            which was modelled on the Welsh language that had fascinated Tolkien 
            from boyhood and which he had finally begun to study at Oxford. 
          <p> While Quenya was originally patterned on Finnish, it was later influenced 
            by Latin and Greek. Quenya and Sindarin were both intended to be of 
            a European kind in style and structure (but not in specifics) and 
            both were meant to satisfy Tolkien's aesthetic taste in sound structure. 
            Sindarin, or Grey-elven, resembles Welsh phonologically and has a 
            similar relationship to Quenya, or High-elven, as exists between British 
            (meaning Celtic languages at the time of the Roman invasion) and Latin 
            (both descended from Proto-Indo-European, as both Quenya and Sindarin 
            were descended from Primitive Eldarin). The creation of Primitive 
            Eldarin enabled Tolkien to later outline many other elvish languages, 
            primarily as a backdrop for Quenya and Sindarin. 
          <p> Tolkien had started out to create a language. He was now creating 
            languages, peoples and a world. 
          <p> Tolkien would often create a word by first starting with the needed 
            meaning, then coming up with the forms as they would exist in Quenya 
            and Sindarin. Other times, he would just make up a name in the heat 
            of writing; later, he would either try and determine how the name 
            had reached such a form or he would dismiss the form and come up with 
            a new name. He viewed his languages as real languages that he was 
            discovering, rather than inventing, and in one of his unfinished novels, 
            <em>The Lost Road</em>, he has the protagonist, a philologist, gradually 
            discover the lost words of a previously unknown tongue (Quenya or 
            Sindarin), before being transported back into time towards the source 
            of those words. 
          <p> 
          <hr>
          <h2><a name="2">Characteristics of the Middle-Earth languages</a></h2>
          Tolkien once said that he wrote <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> simply 
          to create a world in which &quot;A star shines on the hour of our meeting&quot; 
          (<em>Elen s&iacute;la lumenn' omentielvo</em>) was a common salutation. 
          While this exaggerates Tolkien's motivation (<em>The Lord of the Rings</em> 
          was originally conceived of simply as a sequel to capitalize on the 
          commercial success of <em>The Hobbit</em>), it does highlight how interrelated 
          writing and linguistic invention were for Tolkien. 
          
      <p> Tolkien developed a very elaborate linguistic background for <em>The 
        Lord of the Rings</em>, for it both as a hypothetically historical document 
        and as an imagined world. He wrote the book as if it were the translation 
        of an ancient manuscript, which he called the Red Book. The Red Book was 
        written in a language called Westron, which was the tongue of the hobbits 
        who narrated the tale. Tolkien decided that languages related to Westron 
        would have to be translated into languages with equivalent relationships 
        to English. The result is two layers of linguistic invention.

          Hobbit English is the imaginary dialect of English that Tolkien chose 
          to translate the hobbits' language into. This language differs somewhat 
          from English, adapting some archaisms to its needs (reflecting the fact 
          that Hobbit Westron was a dialect of Westron): 
          <ul>
            <li>The word <em>mathom</em> is used for a gift of dubious usefulness 
              that one is reluctant to discard; Tolkien adapted it from the Old 
              English <em>mathm</em>, &quot;treasure&quot;. 
            <li>Another example is <em>Thane</em>, an inherited title of the leader 
              of the Took clan of hobbits, adapted from the Old English <em>thegn</em>, 
              a title for a noble who served an earl. 
            <li>The word <em>orc</em> is used to describe goblins and is from 
              the Old English word for &quot;demon&quot;, a word used in Beowulf. 
          </ul>
          
      <p>One of the most interesting parts of Hobbit English isn't even used in 
        the text of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, but is reserved for the appendices. 
        Tolkien posed a linguistic what-if question: What if the Latin calendar's 
        names for months hadn't supplanted the Anglo-Saxon names? What would the 
        names of months look like in English then? The result is names like <em>Afteryule</em> 
        for January and <em>Blotmath</em> for October, names true to the original 
        forms. The fact that such details had to be crammed into an appendix illustrates 
        how -- even though Tolkien was primarily interested in the languages -- 
        he could subordinate that material to the story when appropriate, including 
        it as notes rather than cluttering the story. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In ancient times, the hobbits lived near the riders of Rohan, whose language 
        had changed little from those times. With Hobbit Westron now translated 
        as English, to convey this relationship Tolkien translated the language 
        of the Rohirrim (in the hypothetical manuscript) into words and names 
        that were similar, though not exactly like, Old English words and names. 
      </p>
      <p> Since Tolkien conceived of the language of Dale and the Long Lake 
            (regions in Middle Earth) as somewhat more removed from the hobbits' 
            language, he represented it as Old Norse in a few names, primarily 
            that of the dwarves. While dwarves had their own language, they considered 
            their names private and adopted outward names that were common among 
            the people they dwelt by. 
          <p> Westron is descended from the human Adu^naic language, but almost 
            all of the names in Gondor are Elvish, as a result of the long alliance 
            between the men of Gondor and the elves in their wars against the 
            dark powers. 
          
      <p> The Elvish languages were of course the source of most of Tolkien's 
        energies when it came to the creation of model languages. For these languages, 
        Tolkien created a vocabulary of incredible detail. By 1938, he had prepared 
        a base vocabulary of 800 root words of Primitive Eldarin, from which he 
        could derive many other words for many other languages. For instance, 
        the root <em>*bes-</em> meant &quot;wed&quot; and had descendents <em>*besno/</em>, 
        &quot;husband&quot;; <em>*besse/</em>, &quot;wife&quot;; and <em>*besu/</em>, 
        <dual
form> &quot;husband and wife, married pair&quot;; and <em>*besta/</em>, &quot;matrimony&quot;. 
        Each of these roots then had different descendants in different languages; 
        the six known descendents of just <em>*besno</em>, &quot;husband&quot; 
        are shown below.

      <p>Incidentally, the asterisk is a common philological symbol to indicate 
        that there is no direct extant evidence that such a form existed but it 
        is assumed to exist based on reconstruction from the available descendents. 
        The asterisk is frequently used to indicate Indo-European roots, from 
        which most European languages are descended. Tolkien used it to indicate 
        that the root forms had been reconstructed by Elvish scholars. </p>
      <p> Tolkien developed a regular system of sound change to govern how 
            words were typically modified from Primitive Eldarin to the descendent 
            languages. Sometimes these regular sound changes were overridden, 
            as in Danian <em>beorn</em>, whose form developed idiosyncratically 
            under the influence of <em>*ber(n)o/</em>, which had come to mean 
            &quot;man&quot; by semantic change, broadening its meaning from &quot;valiant 
            man&quot;. Such an instance of semantic change demonstrates how richly 
            Tolkien developed his model languages in order to make them more true 
            to real life linguistic processes. After all, as his son Christopher 
            Tolkien -- close confidant and later editor of many of his father's 
            papers -- was to phrase it: 
          <blockquote><cite> &quot;He did not, after all, invent new words and 
            names arbitrarily: in principle, he devised them from within the historical 
            structure, proceeding from the bases or primitive stems, adding suffix 
            or prefix or forming compounds, deciding (or, as he would have said, 
            finding out) when the word came into the language, following through 
            the regular changes of form that it would thus have undergone, and 
            observing the possibilities of formal or semantic influence from other 
            words in the course of its history. Such a word would then exist for 
            him, and he would know it. As the whole system evolved and expanded, 
            the possibilities for word and name became greater and greater.&quot; 
            (Christopher Tolkien, <em>The Lost Road and Other Writings</em>, p. 
            342) </cite></blockquote>
          Or as Tolkien himself put in when writing about Niggle: &quot;He used 
          to spend a long time on a single leaf, trying to catch its shape, and 
          its sheen, and the glistening of dewdrops on its edges. Yet he wanted 
          to paint a whole tree, with all of its leaves in the same style, and 
          all of them different.&quot; 
          <p> As the cognate terms of <em>besno/</em> imply, Tolkien had conceived 
            of a complex tree of interrelated languages.

          This is just one of Tolkien's conceptions (circa 1937) of the interrelationships 
          of the Elvish languages. He often revised it and reconsidered it. However, 
          the two principal languages were always Quenya and Noldirin (the earlier 
          name of Sindarin). 
          <p> Tolkien invented the most elaborate model language system ever published 
            as part of a work of fiction. What had started out quite simple had 
            grown. Yet, again and again, Tolkien failed to prepare a final grammar 
            and lexicon for any of his languages. His goal was not to create a 
            finished language system, but to simply delight in creating words 
            and linguistic shapes in the fabric of an imagined time. The joy was 
            in the finding. 
          <p> Here is the most well known of Tolkien's Elvish poems. This is a 
            hymn to Elbereth that was sung in the house of Elrond in <em>The Fellowship 
            Of The Ring</em>:

          For Tolkien, inventing model languages was an intellectual exercise 
          of great seriousness, yet he realized how unusual these activities were. 
          While he felt many children created simple languages, as he and his 
          cousins had done, he was not aware of many others who took inventing 
          languages as seriously as he did. Indeed, while he found his &quot;private 
          lang.&quot; activities to be a source of constant amusement, he would 
          dismiss these activities when discussing them, calling it &quot;a mad 
          hobby&quot; when talking to friends or &quot;my nonsense fairy language&quot; 
          when talking about it with his wife. 
          <p> Yet for him his model languages were an almost spiritual exercise 
            as he followed his love of language and myth. He viewed his creation 
            of languages as a Christian art, an act of subcreation that assisted 
            the Lord in creating the world, perhaps creating even a part of heaven. 
          <p> Tolkien's Niggle, once he had completed his &quot;long&quot; and 
            &quot;distasteful&quot; journey (an allegory for death), at last found 
            his way to a new country: 
          <blockquote><cite> Before him stood the Tree, his Tree, finished. If 
            you could say that of a Tree that was alive, its leaves opening, its 
            branches growing and bending in the wind that Niggle had so often 
            felt or guessed, and had so often failed to catch. He gazed at the 
            Tree, and slowly he lifted his arms and opened them wide.<br>
            &quot;It's a gift!&quot; he said. </cite></blockquote>

            <cite> &quot;Two of the Elvish tongues appear in this book... They 
            are intended (a) to be definitely of a European kind in style and 
            structure (not in detail); and (b) to be specially pleasant. The former 
            is not difficult to achieve; but the latter is more difficult, since 
            individual's personal predilections, especially in the phonetic structure 
            of languages, varies widely, even when modified by the imposed languages 
            (including their so-called native tongue).<br>
            &quot;I have therefore pleased myself. The archaic language of lore 
            is meant to be a kind of Elven-latin, and by transcribing it into 
            a spelling closely resembling that of Latin (except that y is only 
            used a consonant as y in E. Yes) the similarity to Latin has been 
            increased ocularly. Actually it might be said to be composed on a 
            Latin basis with two other (main) ingredients that happen to give 
            me phonaesthetic pleasure: Finnish and Greek. It is however less consonantal 
            than any of the three. This language is High-elven or in its own terms 
            Quenya (Elvish).&quot;</cite>
