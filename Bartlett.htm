      <p align="left">Date: Tue, 4 Jun 1996 </p>
      <p align="left">From: Paul O Bartlett</p>
      <p align="left">To: Conlang List &lt;conlang@diku.dk&gt;</p>
      <p align="left">Subject: CONLANG: Frater: an IAL from Vietnam</p>
      <p align="left">Yesterday, I was browsing at the U.S. Library of Congress, 
        and I came across a rather unusual auxiliary language. As the readers 
        of CONLANG know, the overwhelming majority of international auxiliary 
        language (IAL) projects are of European ambiance: their authors are from 
        Europe or North America, with a few from Latin (i.e., European) America. 
        Afrihili is different: it comes from Africa.</p>
      <p align="left">K. A. Kumi Attobrah<br>
        <i>Ni Afrihili Oluga: The African Continental Language<br>
        </i>Accra, Ghana; 2nd ed., 1973<br>
        Lib. of Cong. call no. PM8063.A8 1973<br>
        no ISBN</p>
      <p align="left">Language of discussion is English, and the physical format 
        is a bit odd. Although I did not measure it, the dimensions of the book 
        were perhaps 12x35 cm. It was a book of ten lessons. Regrettably, there 
        was no English key for many of the examples.</p>
      <p align="left">In the introduction, the author wrote,</p>
      <p align="left"><cite>El-Afrihili is an African language which has been 
        created incorporating grammar and words from the languages of the African 
        continent. It also contains words from many other sources so Africanized 
        that they do not appear foreign.</cite></p>
      <p align="left"><cite>...</cite></p>
      <p align="left"><cite>El-Afrihili has been created with a view for it being 
        adopted as the lingua franca of Africa.</cite></p>
      <p align="left">Unfortunately, the author does not identify his source languages, 
        and as I have no experience with such, all I can say is that the result 
        was totally unintelligible at sight to an Indo-European-only speaker.</p>
      <p align="left">From what I could tell, the phonology of Afrihili would 
        not be too difficult for Indo-European speakers. The orthography used 
        the unaccented Roman alphabet with the addition of two non-Roman letters: 
        an e-vowel much like the vowel in French <i>meme</i> (SAMPA IPA /E/) and 
        shaped much like a backwards Arabic numeral '3', and an o-vowel much like 
        the vowel in English <i>nought</i> or <i>naught</i> (SAMPA IPA /O:/) shaped 
        like the IPA symbol representing the same sound. In the sample, I will 
        represent these letters by <i>e^</i> (e-circumflex) and <i>o`</i> (o-grave).</p>
      <p align="left">Afrihili's grammar, at first perusal, was definitely non-Indo-European. 
        It used categories and made distinctions unknown to IE tongues of my acquaintance. 
        However, I did not have the time to copy down copious examples, but I 
        noted such things as different kinds of future tenses, and so on. Consider 
        nouns. As a somewhat schematized synthetic language, in Afrihili all nouns, 
        and only nouns, both begin and end in vowels. To form the plural of a 
        noun, convert the initial vowel into the terminal vowel! There were also 
        various kinds of infixes which change the meaning of a word, such as relationship 
        to the speaker.</p>
      <p align="left">The following is a short sample of Afrihili. Again, because 
        there was no key, I cannot give a translation of it.</p>

      <p align="left">Yesterday I was at the U.S. Library of Congress, and I had 
        the chance to peruse the book on Eurolengo. Some of you may already be 
        familiar with it, but I thought I would toss out a brief review. </p>

      <p align="left">There are only 7 pages of introductory material, which outline 
        the author's purpose, phonology (nothing startling) and spelling, grammar, 
        and miscellaneous matter (numbers, calendar, etc.), followed by 60 pages 
        of lessons in Eurolengo and English on facing pages, 15 pages of words 
        and phrases in common usage together with prepositions, conjunctions, 
        primary adverbs, and the like, and two vocabularies. The Eurolengo-English 
        vocabulary appears to have about 1800 entries.</p>
      <p align="left">Eurolengo, as one might expect from the name, is a sort 
        of Euroclone, another Anglo-Romance hybrid. The author says that the primary 
        languages are English and Spanish, as these are the two most widely spoken 
        (world-wide) west European languages. He also used the other Romance and 
        Germanic languages to some extent.</p>
      <p align="left">In many ways, Eurolengo reminded me of Phil Hunt's <a href="https://www.warwick.ac.uk/~xuuat/phil/euro.html"><b>Eurolang</b></a> 
        (and more than just in similarity of name). Although Eurolengo did not 
        seem to have Eurolang's word-building affixes, its verb system was a little 
        more extensive than the latter's. I found that after glancing at the pronoun 
        table and the verb endings list, I could more or less read texts without 
        too much difficulty, which, of course, was probably the author's intention.</p>
      <p align="left">Eurolengo seemed to me to be a modest but sincere attempt 
        to provide a common west European auxlang. I don't know whether it went 
        anywhere after the publication of the initial book, as often happens with 
        one-man projects.</p>

      <p align="left">Cc: conlang@diku.dk</p>
      <p align="left">Subject: CONLANG: Eurolengo Reprise</p>
      <p align="left">Recently I posted on CONLANG a brief review of the IAL Eurolengo, 
        published in Britain in 1972. One reader asked for a sample, which I neglected 
        to copy off. Since then, I have had the chance to look at the book again, 
        and I photocopied what I think is a reasonably representative sample of 
        the language, with its English translation.</p>
      <p align="left">Eurolengo does use an acute accent over some vowels solely 
        for the purpose of marking stress, not vowel quality. This is a little 
        curious in practice, since the monosyllabic particle 'ke' is often marked. 
        Why a monosyllable is marked for stress I don't know, but I have reproduced 
        the accents in this sample. (I apologise for not having copied off the 
        pronunciation guide, but the author gave a whole list of &quot;difficult&quot; 
        sounds from various European languages he had eliminated.)</p>

      <p align="left">Lesson nineteen TRAVEL AGENCY Nineteenth lesson</p>
      <p align="left">Now we will talk about visiting a foreign country. If it 
        will be your first visit abroad, it will be wise to go to a travel agent 
        and arrange your journey and your accommodation through him. You will 
        need to know in advance your date of departure, where you will wish to 
        visit and when you will return. He will offer you a choice of traveling 
        by air, by sea and by train or by bus, according to your taste. He will 
        fix a hotel of whatever class or a pension according to the money you 
        can afford. Generally, he will give you an inclusive price for your journey 
        and your accommodation, so that, in a few days, you can go to his office 
        to collect your tickets. As the world becomes smaller and more people 
        wish to travel abroad, there is more demand for reservations, especially 
        in the popular months from May to September inclusive; it is wise to make 
        your plans early. If you have a caravan or a tent, it is only necessary 
        to book your cross channel passage for the departure and the return, because 
        there are so many well equipped camping sites. If you are unlucky and 
        you find that the camping site you have selected is full, you can spend 
        a night in a field or at the side of the road. After all, you are like 
        a snail with you[r] home on your back and you have enough to eat and drink 
        in your caravan or tent. If you are a more experienced traveler, you will 
        make the arrangements yourself, except perhaps the sea crossings.</p>

      <p align="left">Most international auxiliary language projects seems to 
        originate in western Europe and the Americas. Today I had the opportunity 
        to examine one from what was to me an unexpected venue: Vietnam. And the 
        author being Vietnamese in the 1950s, I would have expected the discussion 
        of it to be in French. On the contrary, it was in good English. </p>

      <p align="left">Although the vocabulary is largely, though not totally, 
        Greco-Latin in origin (with some roots modified to fit the phonology), 
        Frater is not just another Euroclone, for its word building and syntax 
        are rather un-European.</p>
      <p align="left">There are 18 pages of forward, largely given over to a brief 
        survey of the IAL movement. Towards the end of the foreward, the author 
        writes,</p>
      <p align="left">With the hope of contributing a modest part in the construction 
        of a satisfactory international language advocated by peace-loving people, 
        I have much pleasure in publishing my world auxiliary project, named Lingua 
        Sistemfrater (Brotherhood Language) or merely Frater.</p>
      <p align="left">Frater based on Latin and Greek roots of international currency 
        is designed with due regard to needs of the Chinese, Japanese and other 
        non-Aryan speech-communities. <i>[Note: this probably accounts for a lot 
        of the root modification-pb]</i></p>
      <p align="left">Frater is usable as an efficient instrument of communication 
        in everyday life and technical discussion. It is easy to learn whatever 
        the mother tongue of the beginner may be. The memory of the beginner has 
        something to bite on thanks to the mnemonic method used in the Frater 
        lexicon.</p>
      <p align="left">To learn, to read, to write and to speak it fluently, it 
        would take an educated man three months and a plain man six months.</p>
      <p align="left">In the foreward, Thai acknowledges the influence of Bodmer's 
        <i>The Loom of Language</i>. </p>
      <h3 align="left">Following the forward are the 12 Rules of Frater (Lingua 
        Sistemfrater):</h3>
      <p align="left"><b>Rule 1.-</b>In Frater, there is neither article nor flexion, 
        nor elision, nor affix, nor concord of tense, of mood, of gender, of number.</p>
      <p align="left"><b>Rule 2.-</b>The noun, the adjective, the verb and the 
        adverb have the same root.</p>
      <p align="left"><b>Rule 3.-</b>The adjective is always placed after the 
        noun with the exception of cardinal numbers.</p>
      <p align="left">The comparative of equality is translated with JE: as...

        having a negative meaning, the adverb NE (not) is omitted.</p>
      <p align="left"><b>Rule 12.-</b>Foreign words, namely international words, 
        if they are formed by the roots existing in Frater, change according to 
        <a href="#Rule10">Rule 10</a>. In case their roots do not exist in Frater, 
        they do not change. They only take the spelling of the language.</p>
      <p align="left">Following these rules are thirteen pages which largely elaborate 
        on them and also deal with interrogatives, which the Rules do not discuss. 
        There are also lists of primary adverbs, conjunctions, and prepositions. 
        Here can can see some non-Greco-Latin elements, such as BSERA (yesterday) 
        and SAFTRA (tomorrow): but compare POSTESAFTRA (day after tomorrow).</p>
      <p align="left">Frater's phonology is fairly simple: there are five vowels 
        and thirteen consonants, written with eighteen letters of the Roman alphabet, 
        CHQVWXYZ not being used. There is little actual description of the sounds, 
        but the vowels AEIOU seem to have more or less the so-called continental 
        pronunciation. Consonants are about as one would expect, except that J 
        is pronounced /z/.</p>
      <p align="left">This simple phonology means that some words, especially 
        proper names, undergo some modification, such as V -&gt; B, as Venezuela 
        -&gt; Benesuela. Also, there seems to be some adaptation to the phonetic 
        habits of non-Europeans: ABRIKO (apricot); ABSOB (absorb).</p>
      <p align="left">Nevertheless, more consonant clusters persisted than I might 
        have expected in a language designed by an Asian. (I am not especially 
        familiar with Vietnamese, and maybe they don't have as much problem with 
        consonant clusters as some other east Asians.) However, if a largely Greco-Latin 
        vocabulary is to be at least marginally recognizable, the roots cannot 
        undergo too much mangling.</p>
      <p align="left">There are several distinctive features of the language which 
        I noted. Roots can serve indifferently as nouns, adjectives, verbs, and 
        adverbs with no modification. (There are no part of speech markers, not 
        even something like <a
href="https://www.access.digex.net/~pobart/glosa.html"><b>Glosa</b></a>'s u/plu.) 
        Except for cardinal numbers, _all_ modifiers come after the word they 
        modify. (A following number is an ordinal.) MENSA MI is &quot;my table.&quot; 
        Unlike most west European languages, Frater does not have separate gender 
        forms for the third person pronoun, even in the singular.</p>
      <p align="left">In compounds, the lexically most significant element comes 
        first, with qualificative roots coming after-this is just the exact opposite 
        of English usage. Frater has no particular system of lexical affixes, 
        in the manner of <a
href="https://wwwtios.cs.utwente.nl/esperanto/"><b>Esperanto</b></a>, <a href="https://members.aol.com/langsource/ido.htm"><b>Ido</b></a>, 
        <a href="https://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/3141/novial.html"><b>Novial</b></a>, 
        or even <a
href="https://ourworld.compuserve.com:80/homepages/Paolo_Castellina"><b>Interlingua</b></a>, 
        but it makes very heavy use of compounding, even in what I call &quot;grammatical 
        stickum&quot; words: TEMKIA (when: TEM = time + KIA = what). Also, sometimes 
        a compound is used in place of an existing Greco-Latin form: ASURAU (alphabet: 
        A + SURA = till + U).</p>
      <p align="left">Following the didactic matter, there are 112 pages of parallel 
        texts in Frater and English, including the entire 1945 Charter of the 
        United Nations. Then come 51 pages of the English-Frater lexicon and 71 
        pages of the Frater-English lexicon.</p>
      <p align="left">I might note here that I could not make a good estimate 
        at first glance how many primary roots there are because of the extensive 
        number of compound entries in the vocabularies.</p>
      <p align="left">I put the book on reserve at the Library of Congress in 
        case I can get back to it in the next three days, but my preliminary impression 
        is that Frater is a workable language which might be more acceptable to 
        east Asians than many of the Euroclones. With its non-west-European compounding 
        and syntax, the learning difficulty is spread out a little more. However, 
        I am not aware that it ever &quot;went anywhere,&quot; like so many IAL 
        projects.</p>

        <i>The Case for an A Priori Language</i><br>
        Cincinnati: Open Sesame Press, 1932</p>
      <p> Oz is an <i>a priori</i> language [with invented vocabulary rather than 
        borrowing vocabulary from natural languages]. Elam also came up with a 
        non-Gregorian calendar and a separate script, inasmuch as he admitted 
        that in the Roman alphabet it presented an &quot;uncouth&quot; (his word) 
        appearance. (It looks like an explosion in a typesetting shop: upper and 
        lower case vowel letters represent different sounds, and 'Q' is a vowel.) 
        The vocabulary was to be based on <i>Roget's Thesaurus</i>. (He seems 
        not to have worked it out in its entirety.) [See <a href="roxhai.htm">Roxhai</a> 
        for an independent attempt at this type of language design.]</p>
      <p> From the introduction:</p>
      <p>&quot;A misapprehension under which the opponents of the <i>a priori</i> 
        method of language construction labor is that an <i>a priori </i>language 
        can be constructed only on the principles of Bishop Wilkins' Real Character 
        or Foster's <a href="mlindex.htm#Ro">Ro</a>. An examination of this book 
        will thoroughly demonstrate<br>
        the fallacy of this assumption.&quot;</p>
      <p> Some sample sentences:</p>
      <p><i>ep ipIv adgIv az afbQt.</i><br>
        I came to the city.<br>
        <i>ep ipIv adglIv az afblQt.</i><br>
        I came from the country.<br>
        <i>ep iplIv adgIv az afblQt.</i><br>
        I went to the country.<br>
        <i>ep iplIv adglIv az afbQt.</i><br>
        I went from the city.<br>
        <i>ep iptIv adIf az afbQt.</i><br>
        I entered the city.<br>
        <i>ep iptIv adlIf az afbQt.</i><br>
        I departed from the city.<br>
        <i>hEv az andAslUt iftlEplezlais kek anpAtpyaup, ek iftEgtOg adpad astlaup.</i><br>

        Tongue</h2>
      <p align="left">From: Paul O Bartlett &lt;pobart@ACCESS.DIGEX.NET&gt; </p>
      <p align="left">Date: Thu, 13 Jun 1996 17:17:58 -0400 (EDT)</p>
      <p align="left">Subject: CONLANG: FOLKSPRAAK: Considered Tutonish?</p>
      <p align="left">I have not participated in the Folkspraak effort, because 
        the only Germanic (more or less) language that I know is English. However, 
        in my conlang browsings at the U.S. Library of Congress, I came across 
        material on what seems to be at least superficially a similar effort from 
        the late 1800s and early 1900s, and I was wondering if the Folkspraakischers 
        have given it any consideration.</p>
      <p align="left">Tutonish was designed and advocated by Elias Molee, an American-born 
        Norwegian, as an Anglo-Germanic &quot;union tongue.&quot; He literally 
        intended it to become the new mother tongue of the Germanic speaking countries, 
        not just an IAL. It has a phonetic spelling, a simplified grammar based 
        somewhat on that of English, and a semi-pan-Teutonic vocabulary. In a 
        manner somewhat reminiscent of Peano, in one of his books he starts out 
        in standard English and introduces changes as he goes along, winding up 
        writing in Tutonish (with a few words explained in parentheses).</p>
      <p align="left">I got the idea that there might be just a touch of &quot;Aryan&quot; 
        racialism in his idea, but it looked like an interesting language experiment 
        at least somewhat akin to Folkspraak.</p>
      <p align="left">Here is the Lord's Prayer in Tutonish. Note that the Tutonish 
        orthography does not use upper-case letters.</p>

      </div>
      <p align="left">Molee published several books, starting in the 1880s. I 
        didn't look at the earlier ones, but apparently they were an appeal for 
        a &quot;Teutonic&quot; English rather than the Romano-Teutonic hybrid 
        it now is. (At least, that's my guess.) He may have later expanded this 
        idea into a common mother tongue (literally) for all the Germanic peoples 
        (all the way to Australia and NZ). Molee proposed that Tutonish be taught 
        in all the schools in all the Germanic countries for a period of time 
        and then phased into official use.</p>
      <p align="left">However, in all fairness I did read one remark about the 
        &quot;Romanic&quot; peoples having a &quot;union tongue&quot; of their 
        own. (Obviously, he was a little early for IALA Interlingua.) From a cursory 
        glance he may have thought that the &quot;Aryan&quot; peoples (I didn't 
        see him actually use the term) should have their own common language, 
        and seemed to think they had/have some de facto superiority in the world, 
        but he was not averse to other &quot;peoples&quot; having their own common 
        tongue, as well.</p>
      <p align="left">His methodology makes quick perusal a little difficult. 
        As I mentioned earlier, he starts with standard English and develops the 
        idea as he goes along, rather than giving any formal description all at 
        once, so you almost have to read the book from the start to pick up all 
        of it (although once you get the phonetic spelling down, you can read 
        a fair bit of it, which was part of the whole idea).</p>
      <p align="left">I am appending an extract from the LoC's online catalog 
        for Molee's works. As with all older items in the online catalog, there 
        is the possibility of transcription errors. (Mainly I looked at item 9, 
        which was the largest and presumably most complete.)</p>
