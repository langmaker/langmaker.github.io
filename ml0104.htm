      <H4 ALIGN="RIGHT"><EM>Ronald Suffield</EM>, &quot;The Tenth Beatitude&quot;</H4>
      <P>This subtle poem by the English philologist Ronald Suffield is actually 
        written at two levels. For Suffield intends that the reader hold in mind 
        not just the current meanings of these words but the original meanings 
        as well. For the meaning of a word changes over time. The example everyone 
        knows is <EM>gay</EM>, which originally meant &quot;merry&quot;, but because 
        some people are a little too merry came to mean &quot;wanton&quot;, and 
        because some people are a little too wanton came to mean &quot;homosexual&quot;, 
        which is the sense almost exclusively used now.</P>
      <P>A model language that you develop will have words that are descended 
        from words with quite different meanings. Some of the words used in Ronald 
        Suffield's poem, <EM>The Tenth Beatitude</EM>, will be used to demonstrate 
        how words change through time.

      <HR ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH="75%">
      <H3><A NAME="BM1a"></A>Pejoration</H3>
      <P>Pejoration is the process by which a word's meaning worsens or degenerates, 
        coming to represent something less favorable than it originally did. Most 
        of the words in Suffield's poem have undergone pejoration.</P>
      <P>For instance, the word <EM>silly</EM> begins Suffield's poem and meant 
        in Old English times &quot;blessed&quot;, which is why Suffield calls 
        his poem a beatitude (Christ's beatitudes begin with &quot;blessed are 
        the...&quot;). How did a word meaning &quot;blessed&quot; come to mean 
        &quot;silly&quot;? Well, since people who are blessed are often innocent 
        and guileless, the word gradually came to mean &quot;innocent&quot;. And 
        some of those who are innocent might be innocent because they haven't 
        the brains to be anything else. And some of those who are innocent might 
        be innocent because they knowingly reject opportunities for temptation. 
        In either case, since the more worldly-wise would take advantage of their 
        opportunities, the innocents must therefore be foolish, which of course 
        is the current primary meaning of the word <EM>silly</EM>.</P>
      <P>The word <EM>goddy</EM> in the poem is a metaplasmus (artful misspelling) 
        of <EM>gaudy</EM>. The word <EM>gaudy</EM> was derived from the Latin 
        word <EM>gaudium</EM>, &quot;joy&quot;, which was applied to praying (as 
        a type of rejoicing). Because the most common prayers in Middle English 
        times were the prayers of the rosary, Middle English <EM>gaude</EM> came 
        to be associated with the rosary and came to mean &quot;an ornamental 
        rosary bead&quot;. Unfortunately, not all who prayed with the rosary were 
        genuinely pious; many were like the Pharisees of old and just wanted to 
        be seen praying -- religion for them was decorative (ornamental) rather 
        than functional. As a result, modern English <EM>gaudy</EM> gradually 
        acquired its current meaning of tasteless or ostentatious ornamentation.</P>
      <P>A related word to <EM>gaudy</EM>, which is not explicitly referenced 
        in Suffield's poem but is implied, is <EM>bead</EM> (in the poem, <EM>bedead</EM> 
        is probably an anagrammatic play on <EM>beaded</EM>). In Middle English 
        times, <EM>bead</EM> (then spelled 'bede') referred only to a rosary bead. 
        Middle English <EM>bede</EM> was itself descended from Old English <EM>gebed</EM>, 
        prayer. The phrase <EM>telling one's beads</EM> was literally &quot;saying 
        one's prayers&quot;, with each rosary bead used to keep count of the number 
        of prayers said. In the days when all English-speaking Christians were 
        Catholics, using the rosary was such a common practice that it was only 
        natural for the word for prayer to become the word for the bead used to 
        say a prayer.</P>
      <P>In this way, Suffield is arguing, deep spiritual communication has been 
        trivialized into a trinket. Modern English <EM>bead</EM> has come so far 
        from its original center that its sphere of meaning no longer includes 
        prayer -- but does include other small round objects, such as beads of 
        sweat.</P>
      <P>The word <EM>rosary</EM>, incidentally, originally was Latin for &quot;a 
        rose garden&quot;, which was applied as a metaphorical description of 
        the prayer cycle, which was &quot;a rose garden of prayers&quot;, with 
        the rose garden symbolizing both the Garden of Eden (or paradise, which 
        originally meant, well we could go on forever...) and the rose of the 
        Virgin Mary.</P>
      <P>A word that has shown similar semantic degeneration to <EM>gaudy</EM> 
        is <EM>tawdry</EM>. In the eighth century, AEthelthy/rth, Queen of Northumbria, 
        abdicated her office and renounced the pleasures of the flesh, having 
        her marriage to the King of Northumbria annulled to become abbess of a 
        monastery on the Isle of Ely. This act of sacrifice and her subsequent 
        holiness prompted others to revere her as a saint. Legend has it that 
        she died of a disease of the throat, a disease that she regarded as judgment 
        upon the vanity of her youth, when she loved to wear beautiful necklaces 
        in court. Eventually, AEthelthy/rth was beatified, and -- as by this time 
        phonetic change had simplified her name to <EM>Audrey</EM> -- she was 
        known as St. Audrey. An annual fair was held in her memory each October 
        17th, and at the fair were sold cheap souvenirs, including a neck lace 
        called <EM>St. Audrey's lace</EM>. In England, the initial [s] of saints' 
        names is often elided (for instance, the town of St. Albans in Hertfordshire 
        is locally pronounced as [talbans] by some). As a result of this process, 
        by the 1800s, the necklaces were called <EM>tawdry laces</EM>. It wasn't 
        long before <EM>tawdry</EM> was applied to the other cheap souvenirs sold 
        at the annual fair, with the result that <EM>tawdry</EM> became a general 
        adjective meaning &quot;gaudy and cheap in appearance&quot;.</P>
      <P>The word <EM>tawdry</EM> is not the only eponymous word to degenerate: 
        the last word in Suffield's first stanza, <EM>maudlin</EM>, is short for 
        Magdalene. Mary Magdalene was the reformed prostitute who wept at Christ's 
        tomb that first Easter morning; this weeping has been memorialized in 
        innumerable medieval paintings and stain-glass windows. As a result, her 
        name came to be used to describe anyone who was weeping, and from there 
        the meaning radiated out to &quot;excessively sentimental.&quot; <EM>Magdalene</EM> 
        came to be pronounced <EM>maudlin</EM> through gradual phonetic change; 
        in fact, <EM>Magdalen College</EM> at Oxford University is locally known 
        as <EM>Maudlin</EM>. <EM>Silly are the goddy tawdry maudlin.</EM></P>
      <P>Moving on to the next line of Suffield's poem (<EM>for they shall christgeewhiz 
        bow down before him</EM>), we find another religious figure, of greater 
        stature than Mary Magdalene or St. Audrey, who has had his name spawn 
        many new words. Of course, this is Jesus Christ, whose name has become 
        an oath. Because swearing is considered inappropriate in polite society, 
        people slightly changed the sound of the invective. <EM>Damn it!</EM> 
        became <EM>darn it!</EM>, <EM>shit!</EM> became <EM>shoot!</EM>, <EM>Jesus!</EM> 
        became <EM>gee</EM>, <EM>gee whiz</EM> and <EM>geez</EM> and <EM>Jesus 
        Christ!</EM> became <EM>Jiminy Crickets</EM>, among others. These euphemistic 
        changes are called minced oaths.</P>
      <P>The final word in Suffield's poem to undergo pejoration is <EM>paternoster</EM>, 
        which is descended from the Latin <EM>pater noster</EM>, which represents 
        &quot;Our Father&quot;, the first words of the Lord's Prayer. As a result 
        of this relationship, the words came to be known as another name for the 
        Lord's Prayer and came to mean one of the large beads on a rosary on which 
        the Paternoster was recited (those beads again!). As its meaning radiated 
        outward from &quot;large bead&quot;, it even came to mean &quot;a weighted 
        fishing line with hooks connected by bead-like swivels&quot;. The word 
        <EM>paternoster</EM> also came to mean any word-formula spoken as a prayer 
        or magic spell. Since the Paternoster was in Latin, and in Medieval times 
        Latin was no longer the native language of any of the reciters, the prayer 
        was often recited quickly and with little regard for the sense of the 
        words. Because of this, <EM>paternoster</EM> came to mean meaningless 
        chatter, words empty of meaning -- this sense of the word gave rise to 
        the form <EM>patter</EM>. (The word <EM>pitter-patter</EM>, though used 
        by Suffield in his poem, is actually etymologically unrelated to the word 
        <EM>patter</EM> with this meaning.)</P>
      <P><EM>Patter</EM> has the sense of meaningless words, and sharp words can 
        become rounded and dull. But although Suffield laments that no word is 
        still the Word [of God], some words do assume a dignity they had not before 
        possessed. 
      <HR ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH="75%">
      <H3><A NAME="BM1b"></A>Amelioration</H3>
      <P>Amelioration is the process by which a word's meaning improves or becomes 
        elevated, coming to represent something more favorable than it originally 
        referred to.</P>
      <P>Two words that have undergone amelioration are <EM>priest</EM> and <EM>prester</EM>. 
        Both words (along with <EM>presbyter</EM>) are descended from the Greek 
        word <EM>presbuteros</EM>, &quot;older man, elder&quot;, a comparative 
        form of the word <EM>presbus</EM>, &quot;old man&quot;. Because churches 
        of most religions are headed by elders and not youth, and because age 
        is often equated with wisdom, the Greek word gradually acquired the meaning 
        of &quot;church leader, priest&quot;. The different forms represent borrowings 
        made at different times, with <EM>priest</EM> being the oldest English 
        form, followed by <EM>prester</EM>, followed by the learned borrowing 
        of <EM>presbyter</EM>.</P>
      <P>In what for Suffield is the greatest example of amelioration, the early 
        Old English word <EM>hl&aacute;fweard</EM>, which if translated using 
        its descendant words would be rendered <EM>loafward</EM>, meant &quot;the 
        keeper of the bread&quot; and was applied to the head of a household. 
        Although &quot;keeper of the bread&quot; might bear witness to the importance 
        of that most basic of foodstuffs to early Anglo-Saxons, alternatively 
        one might argue that it had no more literal sense than <EM>bread-</EM> 
        does in the modern word <EM>breadwinner</EM>. The word <EM>hl&aacute;fweard</EM> 
        has been shortened over time, first to <EM>hl&aacute;ford</EM> and then 
        to <EM>lord</EM>. Over time, the word has been used of not just any head 
        of household but of princes and nobility; this sense was extended to include 
        the Prince of Light, God. For Suffield, this extension of <EM>lord</EM> 
        makes a fitting appellation for Christ, given that Christ was the keeper 
        of the bread of communion. The word <EM>lord</EM>, which ends the poem, 
        stands in start contrast to the demeaning phrase <EM>christgeewhiz</EM> 
        used earlier in the poem as an example of pejoration. By ending the poem 
        with the word <EM>lord</EM>, Suffield offers a hope for redemption for 
        all words.</P>
      <P>Clearly the poet Suffield believes that man has taken the meaning out 
        of God's words, reducing <EM>pater noster</EM> to <EM>patter</EM> and 
        God's son's name to a curse. Yet if he is extreme in his view of pejoration 
        as an example of man's trivialization of God and rejection of divine meaning, 
        the process of semantic change is almost universally condemned by teachers, 
        scholars and other concerned language speakers. In fact, semantic drift 
        is as natural as continental drift and almost as inexorable. The meanings 
        of words change, sometimes for the worse, but sometimes providing useful 
        distinctions. Some words, like <EM>lord</EM>, are even inspired. 
      <HR ALIGN="CENTER">
      <H2><A NAME="BM2"></A>Categories of semantic change</H2>
      <P>As the above discussion shows, many people view semantic change with 
        strong emotions. Some, like Suffield, may even perceive it as an almost 
        diabolical force. The discussion of meaning change is often emotionally 
        charged, with the meanings perceived as &quot;improving&quot; (amelioration) 
        or &quot;worsening&quot; (pejoration) over time. This next section will 
        attempt to provide a more clinical overview of how words change meanings.</P>
      <P>Try this: flip through the dictionary and look at random for a word with 
        four or more meanings, preferably a word you think you know. Chances are 
        you will find that it has an unlikely hodge-podge of meanings, at least 
        one of which will surprise you. Here's what I found when I tried this 
        myself: <EM>daughter</EM> has these senses, among others: 
      <OL>
        <LI>One's female child. 
        <LI>A female descendant. 
        <LI>A woman thought of as if in a parent/child relationship: <EM>a daughter 
          of Christ</EM>. 
        <LI>Something personified as a female descendant: <EM>the Singer sewing 
          machine is the daughter of the loom</EM>. 
        <LI>Physics. The immediate product of the radioactive decay of an element. 
      </OL>
      <P>The last sense makes me want to write a short story, <EM>The Daughter 
        of Fat Man</EM>, in which I could use the word <EM>daughter</EM> in at 
        least three of its senses. How does a word come to have such broad, often 
        very different, meanings?</P>
      <P>At the simplest level, words do undergo only two types of meaning change, 
        not amelioration and pejoration, but <A HREF="#2a"><I>generalization</I></A> 
        (a word's meaning widens to include new concepts), and <A HREF="#2b"><I>specialization</I></A> 
        (a word's meaning contracts to focus on fewer concepts).

      <H3><A NAME="BM2a"></A>Generalization</H3>
      <P>Also known as extension, generalization is the use of a word in a broader 
        realm of meaning than it originally possessed, often referring to all 
        items in a class, rather than one specific item. For instance, <EM>place</EM> 
        derives from Latin <EM>platea</EM>, &quot;broad street&quot;, but its 
        meaning grew broader than the street, to include &quot;a particular city&quot;, 
        &quot;a business office&quot;, &quot;an area dedicated to a specific purpose&quot; 
        before broadening even wider to mean &quot;area&quot;. In the process, 
        the word <EM>place</EM> displaced (!) the Old English word <EM>stow</EM> 
        and became used instead of the Old English word <EM>stede</EM> (which 
        survives in <EM>stead</EM>, <EM>steadfast</EM>, <EM>steady</EM> and -- 
        of course -- <EM>instead</EM>).</P>
      <P>Generalization is a natural process, especially in situations of &quot;language 
        on a shoestring&quot;, where the speaker has a limited vocabulary at her 
        disposal, either because she is young and just acquiring language or because 
        she is not fluent in a second language. A first-year Spanish student on 
        her first vacation in Spain might find herself using the word <EM>coche</EM>, 
        &quot;car&quot;, for cars, trucks, jeeps, buses, and so on. When my son 
        Alexander was two, he used the word <EM>oinju</EM> (from <EM>orange juice</EM>) 
        to refer to any type of juice, including grape juice and apple juice; 
        <EM>wawa</EM> (from <EM>water</EM>) referred to water and hoses, among 
        other things.</P>

        include:</P>

      <H3><A NAME="BM2b"></A>Specialization</H3>
      <P>The opposite of generalization, specialization is the narrowing of a 
        word to refer to what previously would have been but one example of what 
        it referred to. For instance, the word <EM>meat</EM> originally referred 
        to &quot;any type of food&quot;, but came to mean &quot;the flesh of animals 
        as opposed to the flesh of fish&quot;. The original sense of <EM>meat</EM> 
        survives in terms like <EM>mincemeat</EM>, &quot;chopped apples and spices 
        used as a pie filling&quot;; <EM>sweetmeat</EM>, &quot;candy&quot;; and 
        <EM>nutmeat</EM>, &quot;the edible portion of a nut&quot;. When developing 
        your model language, it is meet to leave compounds untouched, even if 
        one of their morphemes has undergone specialization (or any other meaning 
        change).</P>
      <P>For an example from another language, the Japanese word <EM>koto</EM> 
        originally referred to &quot;any type of stringed instrument&quot; but 
        came to be used to refer only a specific instrument with 13 strings, which 
        was played horizontally and was popular in the Edo Period.</P>

      <P>A shift in meaning results from the subsequent action of generalization 
        and specialization over time: a word that has extended into a new area 
        then undergoes narrowing to exclude its original meaning. In the unlikely 
        event that all the senses of <EM>place</EM> except for &quot;a business 
        office&quot; faded away, then <EM>place</EM> would be said to have undergone 
        a shift.

      <H4><A NAME="BM2c1"></A>Generalization</H4>
      <H4><A NAME="BM2c1a"></A>Metonymy</H4>
      <P>Metonymy is a figure of speech where one word is substituted for a related 
        word; the relationship might be that of cause and effect, container and 
        contained, part and whole. For instance, Shakespeare's comment &quot;Is 
        it not strange that sheep's guts should hale souls out of men's bodies?&quot; 
        (from <EM>Much Ado About Nothing</EM>) uses &quot;sheep's guts&quot; to 
        refer to the music produced by harpstrings. Had <EM>guts</EM> come to 
        mean &quot;music&quot;, then the meaning would have shifted due to metonymy.</P>
      <P>The Greek word <EM>d&oacute;ma</EM> originally meant &quot;roof&quot;. 
        In the same way English speakers will metonymically use <EM>roof</EM> 
        to mean &quot;house&quot; (as in &quot;Now we have a roof over our heads&quot;), 
        the Greeks frequently used <EM>d&oacute;ma</EM> to refer to &quot;house&quot;, 
        so that that is now the standard meaning of the word. A Russian word will 
        provide a similar example: <EM>vinograd</EM>, &quot;vineyard&quot;, was 
        so frequently used to refer to &quot;grapes&quot;, as in &quot;Let's have 
        a taste of the vineyard&quot; that it has come to mean &quot;grapes&quot;. 
      <H4><A NAME="BM2c1b"></A>Metaphorical extension</H4>
      <P>Grace Murray Hopper, the late Admiral and computer pioneer, told a story 
        of an early computer that kept calculating incorrectly. When technicians 
        opened up its case to examine the wiring, which physically represented 
        the machine's logic, a huge dead moth was found, shorting out one of the 
        circuits and causing the faulty logic. That moth was the first of its 
        kind to achieve immortality. Because of it, software is now frequently 
        plagued with &quot;bugs&quot;.</P>
      <P>The use of <EM>bug</EM> to refer to an error in computer logic was a 
        metaphorical extension that became so popular that it is now part of the 
        regular meaning of <EM>bug</EM>. The computer industry has a host of words 
        whose meaning has been extended through such metaphors, including <EM>mouse</EM> 
        for that now ubiquitous computer input device (so named because the cord 
        connecting it to the computer made it resemble that cutest of rodents).</P>
      <P>Metaphorical extension is the extension of meaning in a new direction 
        through popular adoption of an originally metaphorical meaning. The <EM>crane</EM> 
        at a construction site was given its name by comparison to the long-necked 
        bird of the same name. When the meaning of the word <EM>daughter</EM> 
        was first extended from that of &quot;one's female child&quot; to &quot;a 
        female descendant&quot; (as in <EM>daughter of Eve</EM>), the listener 
        might not have even noticed that the meaning had been extended.</P>
      <P>Metaphorical extension is almost a natural process undergone by every 
        word. We don't even think of it as meaning change. In its less obvious 
        instances, we don't even see it as extending the meaning of a word. For 
        example, the word <EM>illuminate</EM> originally meant &quot;to light 
        up&quot;, but has broadened to mean &quot;to clarify&quot;, &quot;to edify&quot;. 
        These meanings seem so natural as to be integral parts of the words, where 
        senses such as &quot;to celebrate&quot; and &quot;to adorn a page with 
        designs&quot; seem like more obvious additions.</P>
      <P>A few specific metaphors are common to many different languages, and 
        words can be shown to have undergone similar, if independent, developments. 
        Thus the Welsh word <EM>haul</EM> and the Gaelic word <EM>s&uacute;il</EM>, 
        both meaning &quot;sun&quot;, have both come to mean &quot;eye&quot;. 
        Nor is this metaphor a stranger to English, where the <EM>daisy</EM> was 
        in Old English originally a compound meaning &quot;day's eye&quot;, from 
        its yellow similarity to the sun.</P>
      <P>More often, languages will differ in the precise correspondences between 
        words, so that some languages have broad words with many meanings, which 
        must be translated into multiple words in another language. A word like 
        <EM>paternoster</EM>, discussed earlier, with senses ranging from the 
        &quot;Lord's Prayer&quot; to &quot;a magic spell&quot; to &quot;a large 
        bead&quot; to &quot;a weighted fishing line&quot; will have to be translated 
        into four different words in another language (though I challenge you 
        to find an English-to-language-of-your- choice dictionary that indicates 
        the four meanings of <EM>paternoster</EM>).</P>

      <P>Radiation is metaphorical extension on a grander scale, with new meanings 
        radiating from a central semantic core to embrace many related ideas. 
        The word <EM>head</EM> originally referred to that part of the human body 
        above the rest. Since the top of a nail, pin or screw is, like the human 
        head, the top of a slim outline, that sense has become included in the 
        meaning of <EM>head</EM>. Since the bulb of a cabbage or lettuce is round 
        like the human head, that sense has become included in the meaning of 
        <EM>head</EM>. Know where I'm headed with this? The meaning of the word 
        <EM>head</EM> has radiated out to include the head of a coin (the side 
        picturing the human head), the head of the list (the top item in the list), 
        the head of a table, the head of the family, a head of cattle, $50 a head. 
        But I'll stop while I'm ahead.</P>
      <P>Other words that have similarly radiated meanings outward from a central 
        core include the words <EM>heart</EM>, <EM>root</EM> and <EM>sun</EM>.

      <H4><A NAME="BM2c2"></A>Specialization</H4>
      <P>The only specific subtype of specialization that I have identified is 
        contextual specialization. 
      <H4><A NAME="BM2c2a"></A>Contextual specialization</H4>
      <P>The word <EM>undertaker</EM> originally meant &quot;one who undertakes 
        a task, especially one who is an entrepreneur&quot;. This illustrates 
        contextual specialization, where the meaning of a word is reshaped under 
        pressure from another word that had frequently co-occured with it: thus 
        <EM>undertaker</EM> acquired its meaning from constant use of the phrase 
        <EM>funeral undertaker</EM>; eventually, under the pressure towards euphemism, 
        the word <EM>funeral</EM> was dropped.</P>
      <P>Another example of contextual specialization is <EM>doctor</EM>, which 
        originally meant &quot;a teacher&quot; and then later &quot;an expert&quot;, 
        where it came to be used in the phrase <EM>medical doctor</EM>; now of 
        course this is redundant and <EM>medical</EM> is omitted, with the primary 
        sense of <EM>doctor</EM> having become more specialized.</P>

      <P>Shifts occur when the sense of a word expands and contracts, with the 
        final focus of the meaning different from the original. For some reason, 
        words describing clothing tend to shift meanings more frequently than 
        other words, perhaps because fashion trends come and go, leaving words 
        to seem as old fashioned as the clothing they describe. Who today wants 
        to wear bloomers, knickers or pantaloons?</P>
      <P>The word <EM>pants</EM> has an interesting history. It's ultimate etymon 
        is Old Italian <EM>Pantalone</EM>. In the 1600s, Italy developed commedia 
        dell'arte, a style of comedy based on improvisation using stock characters. 
        Pantalone was a stock character who was portrayed as a foolish old man 
        wearing slippers and tight trousers. Through regular metyonmy, speakers 
        of Old French borrowed his name to describe his Italian trousers. Their 
        word was then borrowed into English as <EM>pantaloon</EM>, which in time 
        was shortened to <EM>pants</EM> and came to mean trousers in general. 
        British speakers of English have modified the meaning again to the sense 
        of &quot;underpants&quot;, resulting in the confusing situation described 
        in Norman Moss' quote above.</P>
      <P>Cast like discarded laundry along the divide separating British and American 
        English are quite a few words for clothing, as the following table shows.</P>

      <P>King James II called the just completed St. Paul's Cathedral <EM>amusing,

        in Cleveland <EM>amusing, awful and artificial</EM>, and you may be accurate 
        but you will mean something quite different from King James. When he lived, 
        those words meant that the cathedral was &quot;pleasing, awe-inspiring 
        and artful&quot; respectively. The meaning of each word has grown more 
        negative with time. People seem much more likely to drag words down than 
        to lift them up, to build museums instead of cathedrals, as the following 
        examples may demonstrate.</P>

      <P>The word <EM>cleave</EM> (meaning &quot;to split or separate&quot; or 
        &quot;to adhere or cling&quot;) is actually two different words, both 
        from the Old English (<EM>cle-ofan</EM> and <EM>cleofian</EM> respectively) 
        but by changes in pronunciation, these words have evolved the same current 
        form. 
      <HR ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH="50%">
      <H4><A NAME="BM2c4"></A>Meaninglessness</H4>
      <P>The nadir of semantics is meaninglessness. The final semantic change. 
        The death of meaning. The defeat of sigor.</P>
      <P>The word <EM>sigor</EM> is Old English for &quot;victory&quot;. It is 
        now meaningless to almost all English speakers, except for those familiar 
        with Old English or with German (where its cognate survives in <EM>Seig</EM>).</P>
      <P>Few now know what <EM>sigor</EM> means. Is this a change in its meaning 
        or a change in the very state of the word? Is death part of life? 
      <HR ALIGN="CENTER">
      <H2><A NAME="BM3"></A>Meaning change across languages</H2>
      <P>Imagine for a moment that <EM>sigor</EM> had survived. It might have 
        been changed to <EM>siyor</EM>, and its meaning could have generalized 
        to &quot;success&quot;. It would then stand in contrast to the German 
        <EM>Seig</EM>.</P>
      <P>Sister languages, or dialects of a language, often have the same basic 
        word with different meanings. These word pairs then become known as &quot;false 
        friends&quot; to speakers trying to learn the other language. For instance, 
        German <EM>Lust</EM> means &quot;pleasure&quot;, which is in fact the 
        original meaning of the English word, which comes from the same common 
        ancestor as <EM>Lust</EM>. In English, <EM>lust</EM> underwent specialization 
        and pejoration, as speakers associated it with only one type of pleasure. 
        The British and American English clothing terms also show how related 
        languages can send words off in different directions over time.</P>
      <P>As you develop your model languages, you should have words in related 
        languages undergo different semantic changes. Situations where a word's 
        meaning changes in two related languages are relatively rare, the example 
        of the Irish and Gaelic words for &quot;sun&quot; evolving into &quot;eye&quot; 
        notwithstanding.</P>
      <P>When languages borrow words, they frequently change the meanings of those 
        borrowings, typically making generic words more specific, in the same 
        way that one language's place names often grew out of another language's 
        generic words for concepts such as &quot;hill&quot;, &quot;river&quot; 
        and &quot;town&quot;. Take the history of the Low German word <EM>spittal</EM>, 
        derived from a generic Romance word for &quot;hospital&quot; but then 
        applied to &quot;a hospital for lepers&quot;.

        old words whose meaning has changed, since the outsider will bring all

      <BLOCKQUOTE> 
        <P><CITE>To say that Bilbo's breath was taken away is no description at 
          all. There are no words left to express his staggerment, since Men changed 
          the language that they learned of elves in the days when all the world 
          was wonderful. Bilbo had heard tell and sing of dragon-hoards before, 
          but the splendour, the lust, the glory of such treasure had never yet 
          come home to him.</CITE> 
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <H4 ALIGN="RIGHT"><EM>J.R.R. Tolkien</EM>, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;</H4>
      <P>If the history of semantic change had to be summed up as one process, 
        it would be that of specialization. The Anglo Saxons 1500 years ago made 
        do with perhaps 30,000 words in their complete vocabulary, while Modern 
        English has anywhere from 500,000 to a million words, depending on whether 
        or not scientific vocabularies are included.</P>
      <P>&quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God, and the Word 
        was with God.&quot; It could be argued that originally there was one word, 
        from which all others have sprung. The origins of language will never 
        be known, but the first language probably had a vocabulary of a few hundred 
        words, providing a rich enough vocabulary for a primitive people who had 
        few materials and fewer abstract concepts. Many of the words of the first 
        languages had very broad senses of meaning.</P>
      <P>For instance, the word <EM>inspire</EM> is from the Latin <EM>inspirare</EM>, 
        which literally means &quot;to breathe into&quot;. Its archaic meaning 
        is &quot;to breathe life into&quot;, with newer meanings like &quot;to 
        be the cause of&quot;, &quot;to elicit&quot;, &quot;to move to action&quot;, 
        &quot;to exalt&quot; and &quot;to guide by divine influence&quot;. Now 
        if a minister were to speak of Adam as <EM>dust inspired</EM>, he might 
        mean by that not just that the dust is having life breathed into it (the 
        original etymological meaning), but also that the dust is being exalted 
        and given form, that it is being moved to action, and that it is being 
        divinely guided (these are the metaphorical or extended meanings). In 
        other words, this minister might not mean just one of the definitions 
        of <EM>inspired</EM> but all of them simultaneously.</P>
      <P>The extended meanings are branches that have split off from the trunk, 
        and our hypothetical minister has simply traced them back to the root.</P>
      <P>If you seek to create a language from an earlier time, you should probably 
        develop a small vocabulary, with it words having much more overlapping 
        of meaning than the vocabularies of modern languages. Imagine a word <EM>spiratholmos</EM> 
        -- an ancient ancestor to Latin <EM>inspirare</EM> -- meaning &quot;wind, 
        breath, voice, spirit.&quot; A speaker who used the word <EM>spiratholmos</EM> 
        would regard the wind in the trees as the breath of the earth, the voice 
        of God, the spirit animating each of us.</P>
      <P>This is different way of looking at words, and prompted Tolkien to write, 
        &quot;There are no words left to express his staggerment, since Men changed 
        the language that they learned of elves in the days when all the world 
        was wonderful.&quot; What Tolkien's elves might have expressed in one 
        word, resonant with meaning, Tolkien's diminutive man cannot express at 
        all.</P>
      <P>Semantic change can be viewed dispassionately as a natural process, but 
        it can also be invested with a spiritual significance, as Tolkien and 
        Suffield have done. A model language is an art form and its crafting can 
        even convey this theme of spiritual isolation. As Ronald Suffield wrote, 
        &quot;no word is still the word, but, a loafward has become lord.&quot;
