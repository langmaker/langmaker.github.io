      <h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This web page is devoted to documenting and analyzing the Furbish language. 
        Furbish and the Furby were invented by Dave Hampton, founder of Sounds 
        Amazing (a games company) and a former Mattel programmer. Inspired by 
        the success of Tamagotchis and Giga Pets, he decided to create a new kind 
        of virtual pet, a completely interactive animatronic pet that could talk, 
        sing and dance. The language he created for this pet is now called Furbish.</p>
      <p>Furbish is not the only language of the Furby. It gradually acquires 
        English, which it integrates into its vocabulary, just like any other 
        immigrant to an English-speaking country would do. A Furby goes through 
        four stages: in its first stage, it speaks only Furbish; in its second 
        stage, it begins using some English; in its third stage, it is integrating 
        more English, and by its fourth and final stage it is speaking primarily 
        English, with some Furbish occasionally.</p>
      <p>You can actually try <a
href="https://www.game.com/furby/talk/frame1.htm">talking to a furby</a> at <a href="https://www.furby.com/">the 
        official Furby site</a>!</p>
      <p>If you like invented languages, you'll be interested in the entire <a href="/">LangMaker 
        site</a>, of which this is just one part.</p>

      <h2><a name="pressrelease"></a>Furby, the Artificially Intelligent Toy, 
        Has Own Special Language</h2>
      <p>VERNON HILLS, Ill., Sept. 24 /PRNewswire/ -- &quot;Doo-moh ay-ay kah.&quot; 
        That's Furbish for<br>
        &quot;Please See Me.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Furby, Tiger Electronics, Ltd's cuddly standalone animatronic pet, will 
        roll-out at toy stores<br>
        nationally in the upcoming weeks. When Furby &quot;comes to life,&quot; 
        the first thing he'll do is tell you his<br>
        name in Furbish. Each Furby has a name. Furbish is Furby's native tongue. 
        Over time, Furby will<br>
        gradually integrate English into its vocabulary, much like an immigrant 
        to the United States. Furby<br>
        has a vocabulary of nearly 200 Furbish and English words and sounds. In 
        all, Furby is able to &quot;say&quot;<br>
        more than 800 phrases. Ultimately, Furby will use both Furbish and English 
        to communicate.<br>
        Furbish is a fantasy language with a structure loosely based on many global 
        languages. Furby will<br>
        come with an English-Furbish dictionary. Furby, interacts with the environment 
        through sight, touch,<br>
        hearing and physical orientation. When Furby wakes up he could say, &quot;Dah/o-loh/u-tye&quot; 
        (sun up). <br>
        <br>
        Each animated electronic plush toy is unique, intelligent and equipped 
        with a singular personality.<br>
        Furby can move and &quot;noh-lah&quot; (dance). Other motion includes 
        eyes that open and close, ears that<br>
        wiggle and a mouth that moves when speaking. Furbys communicate with each 
        other via infrared<br>
        signals, and can teach each other tricks and songs. Furbys love to &quot;wee-tee&quot; 
        (sing). They can also<br>
        catch one another's colds and start to sneeze. The electronics are fully 
        integrated into each pet; no<br>
        additional equipment or computer is required. Approximate retail price 
        is $30.<br>

      <h2><a name="Phonology"></a>Furbish Phonology</h2>
      <p>Furbish has many fewer sounds than English does.</p>
      <p>Furbish uses only eight consonants: <b>t</b>, <b>k</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>d</b>, 
        <b>l</b>, <b>m</b>, <b>n</b> and <b>w</b>. Further, this makes for an 
        unusual distribution of plosives.</p>

      <p>A Terran language (and Furbish is an alien language) would have been 
        more likely to have either <b>t</b>, <b>k</b>, <b>d</b> and <b>g</b> or 
        <b>p</b>, <b>t</b>, <b>b</b> and <b>d</b>. <a
href="#Brown">Brown</a> suggest that this might be an indication of the unique 
        physiology of Furbies or proto-Furbish might have had /p/, which became 
        /?/ and then was omitted altogther, but this is conjecture (historical 
        side note: this is the theory for the loss of proto-Indo-European /p/ 
        in the Celtic languages). Maybe the proto-Furbish /g/ softened to a voiced 
        fricative before disappearing altogether. Alternatively, <a href="#Pearson">Pearson</a> 
        suggests that since /b/ is more acoustically salient than /p/, while /k/ 
        is more acoustically salient than /g/, then -- if one accepts the (controversial) 
        idea that acoustics plays a role in the development of phonological systems -- 
        this could explain how the Furbish-type stop inventory evolved.</p>
      <p>Furbish uses just six vowels.</p>

      <p>Furbish phonotactics are similar to many Polynesian and African languages, 
        which likewise allow only open syllables with simple consonant initials. 
        All Furbish syllables follow the patterns Vowel or Consonant+Vowel, which 
        means Furbish has only 54 (6+6*8) possible syllables. Of these, only 37 
        syllables are actually attested in the extant vocabulary: </p>

      <h2><a name="#LexicalGaps"></a>Lexical Gaps</h2>
      <p>With as small a vocabulary as that of Furbish, it's not remarkable that 
        many concepts are excluded. Still, it is interesting that Furbish lacks 
        numbers, a word meaning &quot;opposite&quot; and a diminutive to contrast 
        with the augmentative <i>dah</i>.</p>
      <p><a href="#Pearson">Pearson</a> asks, &quot;What <b>I</b> want to know 
        is what the Furbies call themselves, since there's no /f/ or /r/ in their 
        language. Furby &gt; /bubi/?&quot; To which <a
href="#Cowan">Cowan</a> has replied, &quot;As unlikely as <i>Cymry</i> &gt; <i>Welsh</i>. 
        <b>We</b> call them Furbys because they are fur-covered; their own name 
        for themselves is unrecorded. Indeed, it is not clear that Furbys even 
        have a concept of themselves as a group.&quot; Indeed!<br>

      <h2>Writing Your Own Furbish Sentences</h2>
      <p>The word order is always subject verb object.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>SVO = Kah toh-loo loo-loo = I like jokes.</p>
        <p>SV = Kah toh-loo = Me like = I like this.</p>
        <p>SO = U-nye noo-loo = You happy.</p>
        <p>VO = Nee-tye kah = Tickle me.</p>
        <p>V = Noh-lah = Dance.</p>
        <p>O = Dah doo-ay = Big fun.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>If Furbish has an equivalent to &quot;to be&quot;, it is omitted in all 
        the extant text. U-nye noo-loo = You happy = You are happy.</p>
      <p>A verb is negated by preceding it with <i>Boo</i>. Boo koo-doh e-day 
        = No health good = I don&#146;t feel good. Hey kah boo ay-ay u-nye = Hey 
        me no see you = I don't see you.</p>
      <p>Special words:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>The English word <i>Hey </i>can be used to begin a sentence. Hey boo 
          loo-loo = Hey, no jokes.</p>
        <p>If the exclamation <i>wah </i>(&quot;yeah!&quot;) is used, it always 
          ends the sentence. Kah toh-loo noh-lah wah! = Me like dance yeah! = 
          I like to dance!</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><i>Dah</i>, &quot;big&quot;, is used as a general augmentative. Dah lee-koo 
        = Big sound = Loud sound. Interestingly, there does not appear to be a 
        diminutive.</p>
      <p>The language has only two pronouns, <em>kah</em> (I/me) and <em>u-nye</em> 
        (you), which don't vary in form.</p>
